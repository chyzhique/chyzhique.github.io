<h3>A. Look at the extracts from the dialogue and answer the questions that follow.
</h3>

      <div class="samples">
<i><b>ðŸ‘‰ I entered my mum</b> for a makeover competition...<br>
<b>ðŸ‘‰ I had my hair and make-up done</b> ...</i>
<br><br>
        <ol>
<li> Did Louise enter her mum for the competition herself or did someone else do it for her?<br>
<li> Did Louise do her hair and make-up herself? If not, who did it for her?<br>
<li> Which verb in one of the two examples above is used to indicate that someone else does something for you?</li></ol>
</div>
      
<h3>
B. Study the rule below. Then, find more examples of the causative form in the dialogue.</h3>

      <div class="samples">
        <div class="note">
        
We use <b>the causative form </b>
        <h2>subject + have/get + object + past participle</h2> 
when we do not do something ourselves, but we arrange for someone else to do it for us.<br></div>
        <i>
e.g. I usually <b>have my hair cut</b> once a month.<br>
Look! Sam <b>has had her hair dyed</b> purple!</i>
          
<br><br>
The question and negative forms of the Present Simple and the Past Simple of the causative form are formed with <b>do/does</b> and <b>did</b> respectively.
