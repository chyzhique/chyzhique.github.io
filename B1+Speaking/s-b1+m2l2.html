<br><br>
<b>First:</b> Look at the images and ask me questions.<br>
<b>Who the Person is:</b> my brother, nephew, cousin, colleague<br>
<b>What the Problem is: </b>he can't decide where to go on vacation.<br>
<b>What the Options are: </b><br>
              <u>1) beach resort:</u> he/she can go to an exotic resort on an island where he/she can relax, or do activities around the island. It's a very popular tourist spot, especially during the time of year in which he wants to go; <br>
              <u>2) exploring the wilderness:</u> He/she can take an extreme sport vacation. He can test his strength, survival skills, and endurance every day in the mountains. In places like these, you usually travel alone, and rarely see other people.
