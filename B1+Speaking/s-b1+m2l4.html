ðŸ”‘ There are no right or wrong answers but you must make sure to justify your answer.<br>
ðŸ”‘ Remember this is not a monologue so both speakers must have equal opportunity to speak.<br>
ðŸ”‘ You should listen to your partner's opinion and respond by either agreeing or disagreeing with it.<br>
ðŸ”‘ Focus on the written prompts above the visuals to keep the task in mind.<br>
ðŸ”‘ Don't forget that there are two parts to the task. One part is expressed in the instructions as 'First, talk...' and the second part as 'Then decide...''. <br>
ðŸ”‘ So towards the end of the task, you must reach a decision that you have negotiated with your partner
