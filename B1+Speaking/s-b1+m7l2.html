<b>Situation:</b><br>
I am your friend, and I have a problem. Try to find out what my problem is, and offer me some good advice.
<br><br>
<b>First:</b> Look at the images and ask me questions.<br>
<b>Who the Person is:</b> a friend, son, brother, nephew, cousin, colleague who wears glasses<br>
<b>What the Problem is: </b>he has bad eyesight and doesn't want to have wear glasses<br>
<b>What the Options are: </b><br>
              1)<mark> laser eye surgery:</mark> He can have laser eye surgery to get his vision corrected. It's a fast (about 10 mins), painless procedure with a uick recovery. However, not all eyesight problems can be cured with laser eye surgery and results may vary from patient to patient. It is also quite expensive; <br>
              2)<mark> exploring the wilderness:</mark> He can start wearing contact lenses. Contact lenses move with your eye and have no frames to obstruct vision. You can also change your eye colour with coloured contact lenses. However, it isn't easy for all people to put on contact lenses and some people may not find them comfortable. There is high risk of eye infection if contact lenses are not cleaned with appropriate solution and stored properly.
