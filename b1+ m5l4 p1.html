        </select> the luckiest person I know. Last week she won the lottery and became an instant millionaire.
        When I asked her what she planned to do with her money, she told me she 
        <select id="q2">
          <option value="">2</option>
          <option value="mustn't">mustn't</option>

          <option value="can't">can't</option>

          <option value="could be">could be</option>
          <option value="could have been">could have been</option>
        </select></b> the richest woman in England because no one has won the lottery for the last two weeks,
        this makes her winnings a rollover. Becky says she 
        <select id="q5">
          <option value="">5</option>

      I wanted to do something useful on my summer holiday so I volunteered at a local Turtle Rescue and
        Conservation Centre. My supervisor, Sally, told me that conservation work requires a lot of energy and patience.
        She 
        <select id="q6">
          <option value="">6</option>
          <option value="can't be">can't be</option>
          <option value="must be">must be</option>
        </select></b> right because I've only been doing it for a week and I'm completely exhausted! Yesterday I got up at dawn to help with the morning survey.
        This involves walking along the beach and checking the nests where turtles lay their eggs. The survey lasted into the heat of the day and,
        at one point, I 
        <select id="q7">
          <option value="">7</option>
          <option value="must have looked">must have looked</option>
          <option value="couldn't have looked">couldn't have looked</option>
        </select></b> like I was about to faint because Sally told me to go and take a break.
        This morning I helped to rescue a turtle, which 
        <select id="q8">
          <option value="">8</option>
          <option value="must have injured">must have injured</option>
          <option value="must injure">must injure</option>
        </select></b> its back flipper in the sea, I think a speedboat <b>(9)
        <select id="q9">

          <option value="couldn't have knocked">couldn't have knocked</option>
        </select></b> against it.
        We found it on the beach and transported it back to the Rescue Centre where it was treated immediately.
        The vet said the turtle was lucky. It 
        <select id="q10">
          <option value="">10</option>
          <option value="could have lost">could have lost</option>
          <option value="must have lost">must have lost</option>
        </select></b> its back flipper if we hadn't found it in time. At that moment, I felt that all the hard work was worth it.
