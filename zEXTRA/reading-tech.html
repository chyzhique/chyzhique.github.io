<h3>1. Survey
- get a quick idea of the whole material.</h3>
<ol type="a">
<li> Read the introduction<br>
<li> Look at the chapters, headings and subheadings<br>
<li> Look at the pictures or charts<br>
<li> Read the summary<br>
<li> Look up the study questions 
  </ol>
</div><div class="card">
  
<h3>2. Question- prepare questions that you will find answers to in the material as you read.</h3>
<ul>
<li> Create questions from headings and subheadings. For example, if a heading is about drinking water, you can ask yourself ‚ÄúDoes drinking effects one's health?‚Äù.
<li> Creating questions gives you a purpose as you read, so you pay more attention to what you read.
</div><div class="card">
<h3>3. Read - simply read the text and keep in mind the idea of the material and questions that you seek answers to.</h3>
<ol type="a">
<li> Make notes as you read.
  <li> Highlight the key statement in each paragraph
    </ol>
</div><div class="card">
<h3>4. Recite - answer the questions that you‚Äôd made before reading.</h3>

It improves comprehension as you digest what you‚Äôd read, make sense of it, and analyze answers to your questions. 
</div><div class="card" style="grid-column:1/3">
<h3>5. Review - recollect what you've read to see how much of it you remember.</h3>
<ol type="a">
<li> You should do the review immediately after reading and sometime after. <br>
<li> For maximum retention, don‚Äôt wait for more than 24 hours after reading to do the review. You can lose 80% of what you‚Äôve learned if you wait longer than 24 hours before a review.

 <h2> C. Scanning</h2>
  
<div class="cards">
<div class="card"><h3>What's the idea?</h3>
Go through a chunk of text quickly without translation and focusing on the details.</div>
<div class="card"><h3>AIM:</h3>
- to find specific information in the material.
  </div>
<div class="card"><h3>The main mechanics:</h3>
  <ol>
<li> move your eyes quickly over the text
<li> search for keywords or keyphrases
  </ol>
</div>
<div class="card">
  <h3>When to use?</h3>
  <ol>
<li> to revive understanding of what was read<br>
<li> to answer a specific question
  </ol>
  </div></div>
   <hr>
<h2>D. Detailed Reading</h2>
  
</div><div class="cards">
<div class="card"><h3>What's the idea?</h3>
To analyze every word for a deeper understanding and to extract accurate information.
  </div>
<div class="card"><h3>Process:</h3>
  <ol>
<li>Skimming
<li>Carefully read through
<li>Look up the meaning of unfamiliar words or phrases
<li>Piece words together
  </ol>
  </div></div>
  <hr>
<h2>E. Active reading</h2>
<div class="cards">
<div class="card"><h3>What's the idea?</h3> 
To engage with the material when reading it, understand, analyze and  evaluate it.
  </div>
<div class="card"><h3>AIM:</h3> 
  <ul>
<li>comprehension
<li>retention
  </ul>
  </div></div>
  <div class="card">
<h3>The main mechanics:</h3>

- <b>Ask questions.</b> 
    <blockquote>As you read, ask yourself questions like ‚Äúwhat does this mean,‚Äù ‚Äúwhat is the significance of this statement,‚Äù etc. This way, you‚Äôll fully understand each part of the material.
    </blockquote>
<b>- Look for patterns. </b>
    <blockquote>Try to see the patterns in the reading as a whole. It helps you bring together all the information you‚Äôve read into a meaningful whole.     </blockquote>
- <b>Highlight and make notes.</b>
    <blockquote>As you read, highlight important points in the reading material. Even better, write down comments or notes on the book‚Äôs margins or in a separate notebook.
    </blockquote>
- <b>Link to existing knowledge.</b>
<blockquote>
Try to understand how what you‚Äôre reading relates to what you know about the topic. This way, you‚Äôll clearly see how the information has added to your knowledge.
</blockquote>
- <b>Write a summary.</b>
<blockquote>
Summarize what you‚Äôve read in your own words. Write down the key points. 
</blockquote>
- <b>Test yourself.</b>
<blockquote>
Using what you have read, ask yourself mock questions, and try to answer these. Testing yourself will tell you how well you understand the material and remember.
</blockquote>
- <b>Teach.</b> 
<blockquote>
Try to explain what you‚Äôve read to someone else. When you do so, you‚Äôre inadvertently explaining it to yourself. So, when you teach someone the material you‚Äôd read, you‚Äôll be reviving your understanding of the text and solidifying it.

  <div class="card"><h3>When to use?</h3>
<ul>

<h2>F. Speed Reading</h2>
 <div class="cards"> 
   <div class="card">
  <h3>What's the idea?</h3>
To read every word as fast as you can without loosing comprehension
   </div> <div class="card">
  <h3>AIM:  </h3>
- rapid comprehension and analysis</b>
  </div></div>
   <div class="card">
  <h3>Steps to master speed reading:</h3>

1. <b>Guide your eyes</b> 
  <blockquote>Run a finger or a pen under the words you are reading. Our eyes tend to fixate on moving objects. So, if you run a finger or a pen under the words in a text, your eyes will follow.
Do this faster than you‚Äôll normally read, which trains your eyes to move faster and to read faster.
</blockquote>

2. <b>Deadline strategy </b>
  <blockquote>
Measure how much time it takes you to read a page, then try to beat it. Always remember that whatever can be measured can be managed. 
Simply set a time of 1 ‚Äì 5 minutes and see how many lines you can read in the set time. Then, set the same time again and try to beat it by reading more lines.
  </blockquote>

3. <b>Adjust reading speed.</b> 
  <blockquote>
When speed reading, slow down on the first sentence in a paragraph and increase your speed as you go.<br>
Even automobiles do not come flying out of the garage. Just like a car accelerates until it reaches maximum speed, so start relatively slow and pace up as you go

<h2>G. Structure-Proposition-Evaluation</h2>
 <div class="cards"> <div class="card">
<h3>What's the idea?</h3>
To analyse the structure of content and evaluate its logic and meaningness
   </div>
 <div class="card">
<h3>AIM:</h3>
- develop cognitive functions
   </div></div>
 <div class="card">
<h3>The main mechanics:</h3>  


1. <b>Find the structure of the text.</b> <blockquote>This is simply studying the layout of the text. You can do this by looking at the table of contents or the headings and subheadings in the text.
</blockquote>

2. <b>Find the author-made propositions </b><blockquote>
In each section of the text, find the logical relationships between the author‚Äôs propositions. That is, determine how the statements relate to one another.</blockquote>

3.<b> Evaluate the final arguments and conclusions</b> <blockquote>
Look at the text‚Äôs conclusions and determine whether the statements of the texts actually lead to that conclusion.
