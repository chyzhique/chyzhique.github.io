  Somebody once said that crime doesn't pay. Was he thinking of the robber who <mark>broke into</mark> a shop, only to <mark>make off</mark> with an empty cash register? Television and the Internet are full of stories about criminals who do inexplicable or simply stupid things. Why is it that so many would-be crimes end in disaster for those trying to commit them? And why do we find it so funny? There is, of course, the joy of seeing a villain punished by his or her own stupidity, if not by the law.

Two men from Michigan, USA, were in desperate need of money and decided to turn to crime to solve their financial difficulties. After thinking about it for a while, they concluded that their best bet would be to <mark>hold up</mark> a music store as the security there would not be too tight. If everything went well, they would move on to bigger businesses like supermarkets and why not even banks. On the day of the robbery, the two men felt extremely nervous as this was going to be their first attempt at armed robbery. Nonetheless, they decided to <mark>go through</mark> with their plan. The robbers rushed into the music store and as they were waving their revolvers around, the first one shouted to the terrified assistant and customers: "Nobody move or we shoot!" Unfortunately, when his nervous partner moved, the first robber immediately shot him.

 A young man in Seattle wanted to go for a nice long drive with his best friend. Unfortunately, he had no money for petrol so he decided to steal petrol from a motor home by putting a hose into the tank. The police later found a very ill man curled up next to the motor home near spilt sewage. Later, the man explained to the police that instead of putting the hose into the petrol tank, he put it into the motor home's sewage tank by mistake. The owner of the motor home didn't press charges, because, as he said, he hadn't laughed so hard before in his life.

    It seems that stress reduces one's ability to deal with new situations or ideas. This happened to a man from Illinois, USA, who kidnapped a motorist by pretending to have a gun. He forced the driver to take him to two different cashpoints, where he withdrew money - from his own account. Instead of trying to understand the new situation and behave in an appropriate way, the man continued to behave as before, out of habit.
