The country of the Saints<hr>
<h2>Chapter 1<br>
On the Great Alkali Plain</h2>

Somewhere in the centre of the great North American continent there is a dry and inhospitable desert, which has for many years prevented the
spread of civilisation. It covers an area from the Sierra Nevada to Nebraska, and from the Yellowstone River in the north to the Coloradoriver in the south.
This miserable and barren landscape combines mountains, valleys, rivers and enormous plains, which in winter are white with snow, and in summer
grey with dust. The only inhabitants of this land are the coyote and grizzly bears that search amongst the rocks for something to eat.
<br><br>
A lonely traveller stood on the northern slope of the Sierra Blanco, from which he could see this huge land of miserable nothingness. He looked at the great
flat plain-land and the chain of mountain peaks on the horizon in despair. There was no sign of life, no movement on the dull, grey earth, and no sound to
break the absolute silence. As he looked down, he saw a pathway that stretched across the desert. This was the path that so many adventurers had taken in
the hope of finding water. But what became of them was clear, as here and there were white objects which shone in the sun and stood out against the grey sand.
They were bones: some large and some small. They belonged to oxen and men.
<br><br>
It is difficult to say if the traveller was nearer to forty or to sixty. His face was thin and worn; his eyes were sunken in his head; the hand which held the
rifle was like a skeleton's. It was clear that he was dying - dying from hunger and from thirst. He had climbed here in hope of seeing some signs of water.
Now the plain stretched before his eyes, without a sign anywhere of a plant or tree which might indicate the presence of it. There was no sign of hope. He
realised that his journey had come to an end and that he was about to die.

Before sitting down, he put his useless riffle and a large bundle, which he had been carrying with great difficulty the whole time, on the ground. The
minute the bundle touched the ground, a cry was heard and a small, scared face, with bright, brown eyes appeared from it. 'You've hurt me!' said a
child's voice.
<br><br>
'Have I?' the man asked gently, 'I didn't mean to.' As he spoke, he unwrapped the grey blanket that held the bundle together and took out a little
girl of about five years of age. The child was pale and weak, but her healthy arms and legs showed that she had suffered less than her companion.
<br><br>
'How is it now? ' he asked anxiously, as she was still rubbing the back of her head.
<br><br>
'Kiss it and make it well,' she said showing the injured part to him. ' That's what mother used to do. Where's mother? '
<br><br>
'Mother's gone I guess you'll see her before long.'
<br><br>
'Funny she didn't say goodbye. She's been gone for nearly three days! Say, it's very dry, isn't it? Isn't there any water or anything to eat? '
<br><br>
'No, there isn't anything, dearie. You'll just need to be patient for a while, and then you'll be all right. Put your head up against me like that, and then
you'll feel better.'
<br><br>
After she had said a prayer, the child fell asleep. He watched over her for some time, but then he too fell asleep.
<br><br>
Far away in the distance a cloud of dust began to rise and as it came nearer to where the child and man were sleeping, it became clear that a group of
nomads was heading in their direction.
