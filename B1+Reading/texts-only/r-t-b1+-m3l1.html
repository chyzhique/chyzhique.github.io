Brad Charandoff has enjoyed an adrenaline rush since he was a child. Growing up on a ranch, he had plenty of opportunity for adventure. 
  <span id="td1" style="background-color: yellow; border: 1px solid black; border-radius:7px">1.
  <select id="select1" style="font-size:1rem">
            <option value="">?</option>

When he was thirteen, he started competing in rodeos. He was immediately fascinated by the rodeo clowns.
<br><br>
Rodeo clowns are an essential part of the sport of bull riding. During the competition, a cowboy gets onto a bull, which does its best to buck him off. The cowboy who can stay on the longest is the winner. But sooner or later, all of them fall or jump off the bull.
    <span id="td2" style="background-color: yellow; border: 1px solid black; border-radius:7px">2.
  <select id="select2" style="font-size:1rem">
            <option value="">?</option>
            <option value="valuea">A</option>
            <option value="valueb">B</option>
            <option value="valuec">C</option>
            <option value="valued">D</option>
            <option value="valuee">E</option>
            <option value="valuef">F</option>
            <option value="valueg">G</option>
          </select></span>
  To do this, they wear colourful, baggy clothes, and may run in front of the bull or throw something at it. 
<br><br>
Naturally, playing with half-wild bulls is a dangerous job.   <span id="td3" style="background-color: yellow; border: 1px solid black; border-radius:7px">3.
  <select id="select3" style="font-size:1rem">
            <option value="">?</option>
            <option value="valuea">A</option>
            <option value="valueb">B</option>
            <option value="valuec">C</option>
            <option value="valued">D</option>
            <option value="valuee">E</option>
            <option value="valuef">F</option>
            <option value="valueg">G</option>
          </select></span>
  So why does he do it? 'I put myself in danger to help others,' he says, 'I also love entertaining the crowd. I've always been the kid who could make people laugh.'

Gus Wong is a fingerprint analyst at a police station. His job is responsible, though less dangerous than Brad's. Analysts use fingerprints to identify criminals. 'Criminals can move away,
change their hair colour, even their names,' says Gus. 'But they can't change their fingerprints.
    <span id="td4" style="background-color: yellow; border: 1px solid black; border-radius:7px">4.
  <select id="select4" style="font-size:1rem">
            <option value="">?</option>
            <option value="valuea">A</option>
            <option value="valueb">B</option>
            <option value="valuec">C</option>
            <option value="valued">D</option>
            <option value="valuee">E</option>
            <option value="valuef">F</option>
            <option value="valueg">G</option>
          </select></span>
  That way, even if a criminal has changed
his name, he can be identified.
<br><br>
  <span id="td5" style="background-color: yellow; border: 1px solid black; border-radius:7px">5.
  <select id="select5" style="font-size:1rem">
            <option value="">?</option>
            <option value="valuea">A</option>
            <option value="valueb">B</option>
            <option value="valuec">C</option>
            <option value="valued">D</option>
            <option value="valuee">E</option>
            <option value="valuef">F</option>
            <option value="valueg">G</option>
          </select></span>
  Many employers also require them to have a post-secondary degree. 'You need good computer skills, an eye for detail and a lot of patience,' adds Gus. 'I have analysed thousands of individual fingerprints over my career. It is often exhausting, but I have seen many criminals convicted because of evidence that I found.'

Richard Beamish also works behind the scenes. He's a professional actor, but you won't ever see his face. Richard is a voice actor - one of the people who give their voices to characters in cartoons, video games and commercials. Voice actors use their voices to help create a unique and interesting character.
<br><br>
For the past three years, Richard has provided the voice of the character Twinkle in the children's television show Space Club.   <span id="td6" style="background-color: yellow; border: 1px solid black; border-radius:7px">6.
  <select id="select6" style="font-size:1rem">
            <option value="">?</option>
            <option value="valuea">A</option>
            <option value="valueb">B</option>
            <option value="valuec">C</option>
            <option value="valued">D</option>
            <option value="valuee">E</option>
            <option value="valuef">F</option>
            <option value="valueg">G</option>
          </select></span>
  Most voice actors don't get hired to do cartoons right away - they need to get experience doing less glamoro us work such as recordings for commercials. However, this isn't the case with Richard. 'The director gave me a description of the character, a sketch of how he looked, and a piece of script I created his voice from that and they liked what they heard!'
<br><br>
Richard loves the experience of recording the shows. 'We start at nine in the morning. I try to read the script quickly before we start. but I have been playing Twinkle for so long I know exactly how he should sound. We sit in a circle with our mikes, and then the silliness begins.</div>
