There are very few people today who would
disagree with the opinion that the mass
media have a powerful influence on shaping
life in the modern world. Nevertheless,
the introduction of Mass Media Studies
in American schools and universities was
opposed by some people. Many educators were
worried that the focus in this new academic
subject would be on less important matters,
such as rumours or gossip concerning movie
stars and what are now known as celebrities.
However, it is the responsible behaviour of
curriculum designers and teachers which
has largely prevented such a development.
The emphasis has been on how television,
the press and the new technologies are
organised and controlled.

Film Studies, which is a branch of Media
Studies, is a very popular optional course as
motion pictures are particularly interesting
to teenagers and college students. Apart
from describing the way the Hollywood
studios make movies, the course also includes
general principles about movie making. The
increasing availability of reasonably priced
light digital cameras, and access to Internet
sites, such as Youtube. has made it cheaper
and easier to produce movies and to find
viewers for the movie. in a world where young
people are repeatedly criticised for lack of
imagination and lack of independence, the
ability to understand how society works and
a chance to become actively involved in the
world, are important benefits which come
from having Media Studies on school and
college curricula.</div>
