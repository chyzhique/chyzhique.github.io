The benefits of massage have been well pointed out by doctors around the world. A massage helps relieve pain and
stiffness in the muscles and joints, lowers blood pressure and increases blood circulation as well. Some people also
believe that massages <mark>promote</mark> a healthy mind in a healthy body by helping you to relax and reduce your anxiety. I
decided to put the 'miracle massage' to the test when the Miraval Spa and Resort in Tucson, Arizona invited the
editors of several magazines to spend a complimentary weekend there.
<br><br>
When I got to Tucson, the Miraval Spa and Resort stood out like an oasis in the <mark>scorching</mark> Arizona desert. Its brightly
coloured buildings were surrounded by many palm trees and tropical flowers, a sight with which the bare mountains in the
distance made a striking contrast. I found it hard to believe that this paradise existed there in the middle of the desert.
<br><br>
The moment I stepped into the spa, I was surrounded by a welcoming staff who were willing to <mark>cater for</mark> my every
need. Before I even got a chance to introduce myself, I was led to my luxury suite. When I opened the door of my suite,
I saw the marvellous view of the three-level swimming pool, with its huge waterfall, and the desert mountains in
the background. It was hard not to rest on the king size bed and sleep right away, but I decided to go straight to the
massage area.
<br><br>
The Miraval offers a variety of massages, including hot stone massage and hydrotherapy. I decided on the hot stone
treatment. When I was on the massage table, I watched the hot steam coming off the stones that were about to be
put onto my body and had second thoughts. However, the moment the masseuse placed the first hot stone on my skin,
I felt a calm, warm energy spread throughout my <mark>entire</mark> body. The masseuse told me to relax as she placed more
stones on my back and I found myself drifting off to sleep.
<br><br>
When I woke up, I was completely relaxed. I realised there was another woman in the room, and she was massaging
my face. She put a warm mask on my face, and told me it would help clean my skin. When she washed off the mask,
she told me it was time to sit in the jacuzzi for a while. At first, I found it hard to get off the massage table because I
wanted to stay there and sleep; however, <mark>switching</mark> to the jacuzzi turned out to be a wonderful idea. I relaxed in the
warm water for about an hour.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, dinner had been prepared for me in my room. I found a table lit with candles and an impressive meal of
fresh fish, steamed vegetables and a selection of exotic fruit fer dessert. I ate my dinner and lay down on my bed. I was
so relaxed that I fell asleep right away.
<br><br>
The next day, I woke up earlier than usual and full of energy. I had a light but delicious breakfast of freshly
squeezed orange juice and yoghurt with fresh fruit, then went to do a little Yoga. The Miraval offers Yoga and Pilates
classes, which are held outside by the pool. After an hour of Yoga, I decided to go for a dip in the pool. I felt refreshed
and relaxed and wanted to try some horse back riding. This might seem unbelievable, but it is something that I had
never done before.
<br><br>
My instructor and I rode into the desert. As we galloped around the resort, I felt like a cowboy in the Wild West. My
instructor said that I was doing great. even though I was afraid of falling off the horse. We rode back to the resort
and, although I was quite hungry after all the mornings activities, I had a light lunch consisting of only iced tea,
salad and fruit. I spent the afternoon in the gardens of the resort, feeling perfectly content.
<br><br>
I woke up the next morning with the sun shining on me. and I realised my weekend there was at an end. I left the
resort feeling healthy and at peace, knowing that I would definitely return some day.
