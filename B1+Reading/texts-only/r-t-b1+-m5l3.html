Josh Lemming has a very strange hobby. He
collects aeroplane, bus and train tickets from
every place he has ever travelled to. so far, he
has over 1000 tickets. He arranges them in photo
albums according to date, type and country.
<br><br>
'When I mention my collection,' says Josh, 'most
people <mark>respond</mark>, "You can't he serious." But once
they see my albums, they realise I'm actually
pretty serious. I'm a photographer. so I travel a
lot. I've been to over 50 countries.
<br><br>
Josh began collecting his tickets about 10 years
ago. 'It may seem a little crazy. but one day, as I
was getting off a bus in Madrid, Spain. I decided
to keep my bus ticket, instead of throwing it away.
After that. I never threw away another ticket.

She is an <mark>avid</mark> stamp collector, and has
stamps dating back to the early 1900s. 'After
seing the way she organised her stamps. I decided
to organise my tickets in a similar manner. Mine
were just in plastic bags. My mother bought me
a bunch of albums for my birthday, and I sorted
through the plastic bags. It must have taken me
abour a month to organise them all. But now, it's
a lot easier to look through my tickets.'
<br><br>
Josh has become well-known in his hometown
of Newcastle. Australia. 
<span id="td2" style="background-color: crimson; border: 1px solid black; border-radius:7px; color:white">2.
  <select id="select2" style="font-size:1rem">
            <option value="">?</option>
            <option value="valuea">A</option>
            <option value="valueb">B</option>
            <option value="valuec">C</option>
            <option value="valued">D</option>

            <option value="valuef">F</option>
            <option value="valueg">G</option>
          </select></span>
Then, a local
newspaper reporter heard about Josh. She called
him and <mark>requested</mark> an interview, as well as a
viewing of his collection. 'Iwas really surprised to
learn that the local newspaper was interested in
my collection. But then again. I guess people like
hearing about <mark>peculiar</mark> things.'
<br><br>
After the newspaper <mark>published </mark>an article on
Josh called The Ticket Collector, more and more
people began contacting Josh in order to view his
collection,

            <option value="valuef">F</option>
            <option value="valueg">G</option>
          </select></span>
Marie Newton, a local resident,
started collecting her own travel tickets. 'I found
Josh's collection to be a great way to keep a
record of all the places I've been to. After seeing
it, I decided to start saving my tickets, though I
definitely don't travel as much as he does, It might
actually make me start travelling more!'

'It was kind of strange'. he explains. All of
a sudden I was getting all this attention simply for
doing something that was meaningful to me, But
now I'm used to it, Plus, in a way. I'm proud of my
collection. It represents a lot of hard work.'
<br><br>
Josh continues to collect his travel tickets.
However, he has started a new collection - cinema
tickets.

            <option value="valuef">F</option>
            <option value="valueg">G</option>
          </select></span>
'So far, I only have about 65
tickets, Josh says, 'but that's only one year's worth,
I plan on seeing a lot more films, believe me.'
He has already begun organising the tickets in
albums, which were, again. a gift from his mum.

'One day, I hope to sit down with my
children and show them all the things I have
collected. Hopefully. they'll <mark>appreciate</mark> it - after all.
it seems like collecting runs in the family.'</div></div>
