Bedouins are nomads who live in the deserts of the Middle East and
North Africa. In the past, they were known as the wanderers of the
desert because they travelled by camel, moving from oasis to oasis
with their herds of sheep, goats and camels. They had to constantly move because of the hard desert
environment in which they lived. They travelled in small groups of related tribes. The leaders of those
groups were called sheikhs, and this position was handed down from father to son for generations.
<br><br>
Bedouins are famous for their hospitality and generosity. This comes from living in one of the
hottest and driest regions on Earth, which gives them a shared respect for the dangers of the desert.
Fellow travellers are invited into their tents and offered spiced coffee. As well as being courageous,
Bedouins are also independent and resourceful people, able to survive in some of the harshest
deserts through their knowledge of the seasons and the location of water.
<br><br>
Today's Bedouins are not as traditional as their ancestors; they are more likely to settle on the
outskirts of villages or towns and travel by car. This is because their countries have developed and
new towns and villages have been built. As a result, Bedouins have less land available for their herds
than they used to. Despite this, some Bedouins still live in the desert, maintaining their way of life,
honouring the simple grace and beauty of nature.
