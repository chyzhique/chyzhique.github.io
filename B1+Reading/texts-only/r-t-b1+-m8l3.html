   </div> <hr>
My parents had grown tired of city life and decided to buy a house in a quiet neighbourhood, next to a large forest. I must admit, I saw red when my parents first told me. I was furious about my whole life being turned upside-down. Then, my parents pointed out some of the benefits of moving to the suburbs, like living in a bigger house and having my own room. 
<span id="td1"> 1.
  <select id="select1" style="font-size:1rem">
            <option value="">?</option>
            <option value="valuea">A</option>
            <option value="valueb">B</option>
            <option value="valuec">C</option>
            <option value="valued">D</option>
            <option value="valuee">E</option>
            <option value="valuef">F</option>
            <option value="valueg">G</option>
            <option value="valueh">H</option>
          </select></span>
    There was barely enough room to move in there. So, I slowly warmed to the idea.
<br><br>
The first week was great. I decorated my room just the way I'd always wanted. 
    <span id="td2"> 2.
  <select id="select2" style="font-size:1rem">
            <option value="">?</option>
            <option value="valuea">A</option>
            <option value="valueb">B</option>
            <option value="valuec">C</option>
            <option value="valued">D</option>
            <option value="valuee">E</option>
            <option value="valuef">F</option>
            <option value="valueg">G</option>
            <option value="valueh">H</option>
          </select></span>
    What's more, he didn't let me paint the walls in the colours I wanted, So in my new room, I went wild. I painted the whole room purple and put up posters of my favourite rock stars. Plus, since the room was all mine, I could crank up the volume on my stereo and play my music as loud as I wanted!
<br><br>
 I also got a bike and rode to and from my new school, something I had always wanted to do in the city, but my parents felt was too dangerous. I made friends easily at my new school. 
    <span id="td3"> 3.
  <select id="select3" style="font-size:1rem">
            <option value="">?</option>
            <option value="valuea">A</option>
            <option value="valueb">B</option>
            <option value="valuec">C</option>
            <option value="valued">D</option>
            <option value="valuee">E</option>
            <option value="valuef">F</option>
            <option value="valueg">G</option>
            <option value="valueh">H</option>
          </select></span>
    Many people even smile and wave hello to me when I am walking down the street, which almost never happens in the city. I was also excited when I found out that my new school had a girls' football team, and they needed a new striker. I tried out for the team right away and they picked me!
<br><br>
I got used to our new home and neighbourhood quite quickly. My brother and I were spending more time outside than we ever did when we lived in the city. I was playing football almost every day and I never knew how much fun you can have exploring a forest; I've seen so many wild animals.
    <span id="td4"> 4.
  <select id="select4" style="font-size:1rem">
            <option value="">?</option>
            <option value="valuea">A</option>
            <option value="valueb">B</option>
            <option value="valuec">C</option>
            <option value="valued">D</option>
            <option value="valuee">E</option>
            <option value="valuef">F</option>
            <option value="valueg">G</option>
            <option value="valueh">H</option>
          </select></span>
My mother even planted a little flower garden, which she tends to every day.
    <br><br>
After some time, however, I started to miss some things from the city. There's less to do here after school. Sometimes, in the city, my friends and I would go to a cafe, hang out at the skate park or do some shopping. It was great because it was all so close by. Where I live now, there is only one cinema, and it usually plays old films. Plus, I miss seeing people just walking around.
        <span id="td5"> 5.
  <select id="select5" style="font-size:1rem">
            <option value="">?</option>
            <option value="valuea">A</option>
            <option value="valueb">B</option>
            <option value="valuec">C</option>
            <option value="valued">D</option>
            <option value="valuee">E</option>
            <option value="valuef">F</option>
            <option value="valueg">G</option>
            <option value="valueh">H</option>
          </select></span>
    Here, everything is so far apart that vou usually have to drive.
        <br><br>
And of course, I miss my friends from the city. If only I could visit the city for a weekend! I would do everything that I can't do here. I would hang out with my friends, go to the cinema, and eat at all my favourite Chinese and Italian restaurants. I wish I had realised how man things the suburbs lack. At least, if I had known I couldn't do those things here, I would have taken advantage of my last days in the city and done more before I left.
<br><br>
I've been trying to get my parents to let me visit my friends but they don't want me to travel to the city on my own. We argue about it till we're blue in the face but I think they're coming round. 
        <span id="td6"> 6.
  <select id="select6" style="font-size:1rem">
            <option value="">?</option>
            <option value="valuea">A</option>
            <option value="valueb">B</option>
            <option value="valuec">C</option>
            <option value="valued">D</option>
            <option value="valuee">E</option>
            <option value="valuef">F</option>
            <option value="valueg">G</option>
            <option value="valueh">H</option>
          </select></span>
    I am already making plans for everything I want to do. The first thing I will do is call my best friend, Amy, and get together and do all the stuff we used to do. 
<br><br>
In the future, I want to apply to a university in the city. My parents are fine with my decision.
        <span id="td7"> 7.
  <select id="select7" style="font-size:1rem">
            <option value="">?</option>
            <option value="valuea">A</option>
            <option value="valueb">B</option>
            <option value="valuec">C</option>
            <option value="valued">D</option>
            <option value="valuee">E</option>
            <option value="valuef">F</option>
            <option value="valueg">G</option>
            <option value="valueh">H</option>
          </select></span>
    So, I guess I'm just going to bide my time in the suburbs. until I can return to the hustle and bustle of city life.
