<h1 class="header">Cleaning up the environment:</h1> 
<h3 class="header" style="color:#00DFA2">hard work and creativity</h3>

All communities and industries have an impact on the environment. Sometimes, this impact is so serious that
people become worried about the amount of pollution in their area. But in communities around the world, people
are also finding ways to <mark>clean up</mark> their environments. Here are just two of their stories.
<br><br>
Many cities are built near rivers. Rivers provide water and facilitate transport to communities. They are also
a beautiful setting for biking and walking trails. Birds and other wildlife depend on them for food and habitat.
However, rivers that flow through cities can become choked with rubbish and pollutants. One such river
was the Bow River in Calgary, Canada. One day, twelve-year-old Sandra Crawford was walking along the side
of the Bow River. She noticed an entire mattress lying in the river. She tried to pull it out on her own, but she
could not. So Sandra wrote a letter to the newspaper saying that too much rubbish had been thrown into the
river. Her feelings were shared by many citizens, and they decided to do something about the pollution.
<br><br>
That was back in 1967. Sandra's complaint led to the annual Pathway and River Cleanup. Every May, teams
of volunteers head out to the river to <mark>pick up</mark> rubbish and carry it out. Many people volunteer with their
families, or with their friends or colleagues. Others belong to clubs that do outdoor activities such as hiking,
bird watching, cycling, or fishing. Participation in the cleanup is encouraged by local politicians. Each team
chooses: part of the river to clean up and appoints leader. On the big day, thousands of volunteers have
free breakfast and then get to work! Teams may win prizes, too. One year, the prize went to the team who
found the most unusual piece of rubbish. Some teams found money and abandoned vintage cars. The winner
<mark>came across</mark> a glass bottle full of notes - the thoughts of a homeless man on his life.
<br><br>
Other places are too dirty even for dedicated volunteers to clean up. They need professionals called landscape
architects, who are both scientists and artists. Blacklick Creek, in Pennsylvania, was the site of
coal mine for almost sixty years. 2500 people lived and worked in the town when the mine was operating, but when it <mark>closed
down</mark>, few stayed behind. The mine left not only a ghost town but whole area which has been polluted with old
machinery and harmful chemicals. The water of the creek was so acidic that people used to throw their dogs
in it to kill the fleas. If you swam in the creek, your hair would turn orange. As the water travelled farther away,
it made the water of other towns dirty.
<br><br>
Julie Bargmann had an idea to clean up Blacklick Creek while keeping its history alive. To her, making
old industrial sites clean and safe is an art. While some people might try to hide the damage, Bargmann uses
what she finds to create a new look for the landscape. Orange water is just one of the bizarre colours chemical
pollutants cause. Bargmann allowed water to collect in orange pools and planted bright red sugar maple trees
around them. Over time, the pools will fade to yellow, as the chemicals <mark>break down</mark>. When the water turns
healthy blue colour, the red trees will be replaced by blue-green sycamore trees. Other polluted water
flows into a wetland, where bacteria will eat the sulfur in it, turning it once again into clean water. All the
processes are completely natural and save money as well. Bargmann even left the old mining equipment
and buildings in place so that the people who worked in the mines, often doing dangerous jobs, could visit and
remember their lives there.
<br><br>
No place will ever be the same once a city has been built or an industry has taken something from the earth.
However, places can be kept safe and pleasant to live in visit through the hard work and creativity of people.</div></div>
