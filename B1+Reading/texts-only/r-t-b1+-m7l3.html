Throughout history, there have always been people who have attempted what others consider to be impossible. Whether they are explorers travelling to unknown parts of the world or universe, athletes breaking records or individuals seeking adventure, these people have put their physical and mental strength to the test and managed to do amazing things.
<br><br>
Jason Lewis, an Englishman, is one such adventurer and sportsman. He embarked on a 'man-powered' journey around the world that lasted 13 years. Jason and his teammate, Steve Smith, wanted to test both their physical and mental abilities to the limits, as well as encourage team cooperation.

So, Jason continued and completed the first solo 'man-powered' journey around the world, a total of 46,505 miles in October 2007.
<br><br>
During the trip, Jason relied on many different forms of transport. He walked and swam. He also cycled from Singapore to Mumbai, India and later through Ethiopia and Sudan, as well as through Turkey and mainland Europe.

            <option value="valuec">C</option>

He broke both his legs, one of which became so infected due to blood poisoning 25 that it was under threat of being cut off below the knee.
<br><br>
Fortunately, doctors managed to save both legs and he took a nine-month rest period to heal and recover. He rowed from Mumbai across the Indian Ocean to Sudan and also across the Pacific Ocean, using a unique 'man-powered' wooden pedal boat, called Moksha, which means 'freedom' in Sanskrit.
<br><br>
A typical day on board Moksha involved many different but repetitive activities, such as sleeping and waking in three-hour shifts, fishing, cooking, washing up and also taking care of personal hygiene.

            <option value="valueg">G</option>
            <option value="valueh">H</option>
          </select></span>
He also checked weather reports to predict stormy weather, kept a detailed record of his daily experiences and made drinking water from sea water using a home-made device on the boat. When l asked him why it had been important to keep a record, he replied: 'I had agreed with my sponsors to record the voyage using a camcorder and send reports via satellite to my website. On a daily basis, time for recreation was limited and the only form of relaxation was to read and <mark>take down</mark> my experiences in a diary.' When I asked why he had undertaken such a long, dangerous journey, he replied: 'Well, at first, what I had in mind was to follow the footsteps of the early navigators, like Magellan.'

Jason remarked, 'I had used up eight of my nine lives. The most important thing to do was to be alert all the time!' This <mark>turned out</mark> to be true especially when he was approaching the final part of his extraordinary journey and was crossing a channel in a canoe. He suddenly realised that a three metre crocodile was <mark>going after</mark> him. He managed to escape just in time by jumping out of the canoe and when he reached the shore, he hit the crocodile with a paddle. However, it snapped its jaws shut on the paddle and wouldn't let go.

            <option value="valueh">H</option>
          </select></span>
Another difficulty which he faced was in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, somewhere near Hawaii. Jason said, 'For three weeks I would sleep and wake up to find myself at the same point as before! However, I kept telling myself to think positively and not to get discouraged'
<br><br>
When I asked him if he would go on such a difficult expedition again, Jason replied: 'I think I would.

I have gained tremendous physical and inner strength. It's those moments when you face losing everything that you learn the most about yourself?</div>
