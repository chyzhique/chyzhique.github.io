<h2>Jason Smith</h2> is a mathematician who is working on a program that aims to make virtual surgery a reality.
Imagine the benefits of such technology in use! A surgeon will be able to carry out an
operation on your "digital double*, which is a "virtual you' generated by a computer.
By doing so, the surgeon can learn from any mistakes he/she makes. If the surgeon
is finally certain of success. he/she then will operate on you without any problems.
The surgeon will be able to practise the operation several times before actually
doing it, which means that there will be fewer mistakes,' says Jason.
<br>
This technology is called surgical simulation and is, without doubt, going to save lives. The method of creating a digital double involves complex geometry and
mathematics. The possibilities are endless,' adds Jason. 'If the technology was available right now. patients would even be spared of a trip to the doctor's. A scan would be sent
to the doctor who would make a correct diagnosis and prepare for the operation before asking the patient to come in.

<h2>Jane Watson</h2>
is a plant biologist involved in a project which aims to help farmers investigate and monitor plants and the conditions in which they grow. Presently. farmers grow crops without knowing what the end result will be. If they knew what problems could come up, they would take steps to avoid them. Researchers,
such as Jane. have combined their expertise in an effort to make it easier for farmers to
predict the success of their crops. 'The program is actually a 3D model of a
virtual plant growing.' says Jane. "By entering
different parameters. such as temperature.
we are able to see the effect that they will
have on the plant. Furthermore, once they
have planted their crops, farmers will be able
to keep an eye on them and improve plant
care by giving their crops what they need.
When they need it. When this program is
widely used, it will revolutionise effective crop
management and it will result in cheaper and
better quality food for all.

<h2>Carol Austen</h2>
is an archaeologist who was involved in a ten-year project
named 'Rome Reborn 1.0'. This project used advanced technology
to digitally rebuild ancient Rome.
It is the largest and most complete
simulation of a historic city ever
created. We have digitally recreated monuments that
no longer exist, and we have digitally restored sites
that have been destroyed with time, but this is by far
the most ambitious project ever to be done,' says Carol.
  <br><br>
It is a true 3D model that runs in real time. Users of
the program can work their way through the model as
they wish. They can enter important public buildings
and move around to explore every corner of this
marvellous, historic city. It is sure to serve as a
prototype for other city models of historic value.
'The good thing is that if new discoveries are made.
the program will simply be updated to include them
and this is why I think that we will not be able to
do without it when teaching our children about
ancient Rome,' adds Carol.

<h2>Paul Parker</h2>
is a 15 year-old boy who is
receiving treatment for burns
which he got when a pot of
bolling water fell onto his leg.
It is a well-known fact that the
treatment for a burn is worse
than the actual injury. For this
reason, nurses and physicians at
Nationwide Children's Hospital decided to use
virtual reality games to help young victims put up
with the pain of wound care. Research shows that
anxiety and pain are strongly connected and if
patients are distracted. anxiety is reduced and the
procedure becomes less painful.
At first the nurses gave me books to look at and
sometimes music to listen to, but they did little to
lessen the pain of having my woun draken care of.
Then, one day, they let me play with a virtual reality
game and I was so engrossed in playing the game
that I was surprised when the nurse told me that
she had finished dressing my wounds.' says Paul.</div></div>
