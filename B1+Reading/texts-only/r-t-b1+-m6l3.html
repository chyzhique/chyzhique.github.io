The Columbus Zoo and Aquarium is located in Powell, Ohio, just a few minutes away from the city of Columbus. It has been operating since 1927, and has become one of the most well-known in the world, because of its variety of collections and impressive habitats, and largely due to the promotional efforts of its former director and animal expert 'Jungle' Jack Hanna. Nearly 800 different species of animals are represented in the zoo, with over 6000 animals.

In the reptile habitat, the visitor will be greeted by many exciting animals like snakes, turtles, and lizards. The Columbus Zoo has a reputation for being a world leader in reptile care. The zoo has bred many species of reptiles that were at one time endangered. It's no surprise that the newest member of the reptile family is a python called Fluffy. Fluffy is said to be the largest snake in captivity anywhere in the world. At 24 feet long, Fluffy is very long indeed, and as thick as a tree! Fluffy has a pretty
healthy appetite, as he is fed two 10-pound rabbits a week. He didnt come cheap, either. The zoo paid a <mark>handsome</mark> $35,000 for him.

In the area of the zoo called "Asia Quest", visitors can go through the pachyderm building, which is the
second largest indoor habitat of its kind in the whole world, and the largest in North America. During
the summer, a part of the building leads to an outdoor panoramic view of the elephants when they
are outside. In the exhibit, animals like the Asian Elephant and Black Rhinoceros can be found. The
pachyderm building is so big that up to 10 elephants and 4 rhinos can be held there at the same time.

the zoo, where her habitat, 'Gorillas in the Round' is wildly popular with zoo-goers. In 2006. she celebrated her 50th birthday, and a huge party was <mark>thrown</mark> for her. Of the 16 gorillas living in the Columbus Zoo, 8 of them are related to Colo. The zoo has become one of the most important zoos in

Other regions in the 200 are: North America, Australia, and the Islands of Southeast Asia. There is also a special winter lights show, when some habitats stay open during the winter, and the whole zoo is decorated with lights for Christmas. You can even go ice-skating on the frozen pond!
