The Columbus Zoo and Aquarium is located in Powell, Ohio, just a few minutes away from the
city of Columbus. It has been operating since 1927, and has become one of the most well-known
in the world, because of its variety of collections and impressive habitats, and largely due to the
promotional efforts of its former director and animal expert 'Jungle' Jack Hanna. Nearly 800
different species of animals are represented in the zoo, with over 6000 animals.

In the reptile habitat, the visitor will be greeted by many exciting animals like snakes, turtles, and
lizards. The Columbus Zoo has a reputation for being a world leader in reptile care. The 200 has
bred many species of reptiles that were at one time endangered. It's no surprise that the newest member
of the reptile family is a python called Fluffy. Fluffy is said to be the largest snake in captivitv anvwhere
in the world. At 24 feet long. Fluffy is very long indeed, and as thick as a tree! Fluffy has a pretty
healthy appetite, as he is fed two 10-pound rabbits a week. He didnt come cheap, either. The zoo paid a
handsome $35,000 for him.

In the area of the zoo called "Asia Quest", visitors can go through the pachyderm building, which is the
second largest indoor habitat of its kind in the whole world, and the largest in North America. During
the summer, a part of the building leads to an outdoor panoramic view of the elephants when they
are outside. In the exhibit, animals like the Asian Elephant and Black Rhinoceros can be found. The
pachyderm building is so big that up to 10 elephants and 4 rhinos can be held there at the same time.

In the 'Shores' region of the zoo, two of the most popular habitats can be found: Discovery Reef,
and Manatee Coast. Together, the tanks in both exhibits have around 300,000 gallons of water in
them. Discovery Reef is a large saltwater tank that has over 100,000 gallons of water, in which you can
see mans kinds of species of fish, sharks and turtles. There is also a large live coral reef exhibit, which is
one of the largest of its kind in she US. In Manatee, Coast, visitors will be amazed by impressive
manatee collection the zoo has to offer. This exhibit is one of only three that exist outside Florida, and it
is covered with a roof that opens up so that it can be visited all year.

In 1956, Colo, the world's first gorilla to be born in captivity, was born at the Columbus Zoo. Currently,
she is the third oldest gorilla in captivity, and she makes her home in the African Forest region of
the zoo, where her habitat, 'Gorillas in the Round' is wildly popular with 700-goers. In 2006. she
celebrated her 50th birthday, and a huge party was thrown for her. Ofthe 16 gorillas living in the
Columbus Zoo, 8 of them are related to Colo. The 200 has become one of the most important zoos in
terms of breeding gorillas in captivity, and over 30 have been born since Colo's birth in 1956.

Other regions in the 200 are: North America, Australia, and the Islands of So√ªtheast Asia. There
is also a special winter lights show, when some habitats stay open during the winter, and the whole
zoo is decorated with lights for Christmas. You can even go ice-skating on the frozen pond! The Zoo is
always growing and creating exciting new additions. Plans are now being made for new attractions that
will be opening within the next few years. They will include places like the Polar Frontier, the African
Savannah, South/Central America, as well as a zoo-themed water park, golf course, and hotel resort.
