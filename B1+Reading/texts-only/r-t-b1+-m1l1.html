Mary Terracciano wants her daughter Rosanna,14, to know that she's
there anytime Rosanna needs her and that she'll never let her down.
But she works all day and Rosanna is always busy with school and
activities such as gymnastics practice and hanging out with
her friends. So Mary often sends Rosanna a text message on her
mobile phone. 'I ask her how she's doing or say I love you,' says Mary. It's
aIso easy for Rosanna to tell her mother where she is and when she'll be home. But sometimes, it seems like they are overdoing it
'Quite often I'm in my room and send a text message to my mum who's in the
kitchen,' says Rosanna. 'Texting makes it easy to avoid talking to each other face-to face.'

Jenny Barrett, 41, and Ray Kleinitz, 48, are a happily married couple. But they aren't exactly together yet. Jenny, a doctor, lives in Boston, USA. Ray, a professor, lives in Germany.
Two years ago, they met on an aeroplane. During the sevenhour flight from Germany to Boston, they chatted together. They met for coffee while Ray was in Boston at a conference and wrote each other e-mails after he went home. A few months later they got engaged, and soon they got married. Today, Jenny is working long hours at the hospital and she recently got a promotion. Ray is still teaching in Germany. Every day, they chat together using their computer webcams. 'Jenny doesn't seem so far away when l can see her face,' says Ray.
Ray is looking for a job in Boston so he can be with Jenny all the time, but for now, the Internet keeps this couple together

Adam and Nilaja, both 18, live in the same city and go to the same school. Amazingly, they first started
chatting online and then met in person. Adam used an instant message to ask Nilaja out for the first time.
'I was really nervous. It's easier to ask online than face-to-face.' he says. Nilaja and Adam go out together, but Nilaja agrees 
that it's often easier to express your feelings online than in person. "You can type the words and then just press send.
When we are together, I sometimes freeze up when I want to say something.' Adam adds: 'Instant messaging, however, can be 
problematic. It's easy to get things wrong in a message when you don't hear a person's voice or see their face. You know ,
if you fall out with someone over something like that, it can be hard to find a way to make up again.

Caroline, 24, and Anne-Marie, 23, became friends while they were at university.
But it wasn't until Caroline graduated and left Canada to live in France that they
became close. 'When I left, I used e-mail to keep in touch
with friends and family back home, but I didn't hear anything from Anne-Marie
for about six months.' says Caroline. 'Then I got an email that gave me a feeling
that she was in trouble. I sent her another note, and she told me that she'd had a rough time
- she had broken up with her fianc√©, had difficulty at work and problems with her health. Now we talk online every
day, sometimes for hours. Sometimes it is 11 at night where I am and she is just getting up! She tells me all the time how
much these conversations help her and I know we are better friends now than we ever were. She's actually coming to
France to see me this summer. This will be great because we haven't seen each other for such a long time!'
