<td style=" padding: 10px">You know, I don't see what the fuss is all about. Personally, I hate cold weather. Global warming means I can go swimming all year round, so <mark> for all I care </mark> let it get warmer and warmer.</td></tr><tr>
<th>Richard:</th>
<td style=" padding: 10px">Are you totally insane, Josh? Haven't you understood a word of what scientists have been saying? If the temperature keeps rising, the polar ice caps will melt. As a result, sea levels will rise causing massive flooding. And, yes, you will be able to go swimming all year round - in your back garden!</td></tr><tr>
<th>Josh:</th>
<td style=" padding: 10px">Nonsense! <mark> So what? </mark> Some towns that are miles away from the sea will become beach resorts. Isn't that wonderful? You see, your problem is that you keep focusing on the disadvantages. If you weren't so negative, you would be able to see all the advantages of global warming.</td></tr><tr>
<th>Richard:</th>
<td style=" padding: 10px">What advantages?</td></tr><tr>
<th>Josh:</th>
<td style=" padding: 10px">Well, <mark> for starters </mark>, if the weather gets even warmer, we will save a lot of money on winter clothes. No more hats, boots and heavy coats. I could wear my T-shirts every day and show off my big muscles!</td></tr><tr>
<th>Richard:</th>
<td style=" padding: 10px">Don't you understand that people who live in southern regions would suffer from extreme heat?</td></tr><tr>
<th>Josh:</th>
<td style=" padding: 10px">I don't see what the big deal is. If it gets too hot for people living in the South, they will simply go to the North to cool off. I mean, we've been going South for years to get warm.</td></tr><tr>
<th>Richard:</th>
<td style=" padding: 10px">Yes but â€¦</td></tr><tr>
<th>Josh:</th>
<td style=" padding: 10px">Don't interrupt me. Now, if the polar ice caps were smaller in size, it would be easier to dig for oil in the Arctic, which would mean cheaper petrol for us. Think about how much more often we could use our cars! We could go for nice long drives in the countryside!</td></tr><tr>
<th>Richard:</th>
<td style=" padding: 10px"><mark> l give up! </mark> Josh, you are <mark> a hopeless case! </mark></td></tr>
