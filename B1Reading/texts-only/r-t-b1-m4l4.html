<h1> <center> ANIMAL SOS</center></h1>

According to the World Wildlife Fund, there are hundreds of animal species on the endangered species list. Some of the reasons these animals are endangered include the destruction of natural habitats, pollution and climate change. Most of us <mark> are aware </mark> that the gorilla, the tiger and the giant panda are slowly disappearing, but there are some lesser-known creatures that are also likely <mark> to die out </mark> soon.
<br><br>
One example is the kakapo, a type of parrot which is found in New Zealand. These birds can't fly, and they build their nests on the ground. They eat nuts, seeds and fruit and they sometimes climb trees in search of food. The kakapo is the heaviest parrot in the world, weighing about three kilograms. There were once hundreds of thousands of kakapo in existence, but today there are only about ninety left. These birds are endangered because they are easy <mark> prey </mark> for cats, weasels and rats; their weight and their inability to fly make it difficult for them to escape their <mark> predators </mark> . In order to save the kakapo, New Zealand conservation authorities have taken the last <mark> remaining </mark> birds to protected islands that are predator-free. The authorities hope that the birds will <mark> breed </mark> and that the number of kakapo will increase in the coming years.
<br><br>
Another example of an unusual endangered creature is the Komodo dragon which lives on Komodo Island in Indonesia. The Komodo dragon is the largest lizard on earth, weighing over 100 kilograms and measuring up to three metres in length. Illegal hunting is the main cause of this creature's endangerment, and, at present, there are only about 5000 Komodo dragons in existence. In order to protect the remaining Komodo dragons, Komodo Island has been turned into a national park, where hunting the dragons is forbidden. 
<br><br>
Finally, few people have heard of the Monteverde golden toad, another exotic creature that <mark> features </mark> on the endangered species list. This toad is five centimetres long and its skin is orange and very shiny. Hundreds of golden toads used to live in the tropical forests near the town of Monteverde in Costa Rica, but the last time a golden toad was seen was in 1989. Some researchers are hoping that the toad has moved underground. No one knows exactly why the toad disappeared, but scientists believe it may be as a result of climate change.
