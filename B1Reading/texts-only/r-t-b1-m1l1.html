&emsp; This week, in our series on the world's most famous theme parks, we are visiting The Window of the World theme park in Shenzhen, China. <br><br>
&emsp;  This certainly is a theme park with a difference. The Window of the World contains over 130 <mark> replicas </mark> of the most famous natural and man-made sites in the world, all <mark> squeezed onto </mark> about 480,000 square metres. Some of the replicas are the actual size of the sites while others are smaller. In one afternoon, you can visit the Eiffel Tower, walk around the Grand Canyon and <mark> marvel at </mark> the Egyptian Pyramids. The Acropolis is here along with Niagara Falls.<br><br>
&emsp;  'We want visitors to see and <mark> experience </mark> places and cultures they may not be able to actually get to in person. Not everyone can visit every famous landmark in the world in one lifetime and that is why this park is attractive to many visitors, both Chinese nationals and foreignersâ€™, commented Mr. Chin, one of the managers.<br><br>
&emsp;  The Window of the World theme park <mark> combines </mark> both fun and education. There are regular exhibitions about famous people in history,  and the park often <mark> holds </mark> festivals which focus on different countries and cultural themes. Visitors also have the opportunity to try out food from all over the world in one of the many restaurants.<br><br>
&emsp;  'This week we are holding Indian Week,' explained one of the organisers. 'Visitors can learn all about Indian culture, customs and traditions. We are offering Indian food all week and there is also a special exhibition on famous Indians in history.' <br><br>
&emsp;  Visitors to the park not only have the opportunity to see many famous sites and learn a lot about different world cultures, but they also have the chance to take part in many adventure trips in the park.<br><br>
&emsp;  'We are waiting to go down the Colorado River by boat and some friends of ours are skiing in the Alpine Ski Resort,' said one visitor. 'We actually come from Shenzhen and we think this park is a great benefit for our region. We will probably never be able to visit all of these places ourselves, so it is really interesting for us. Some friends of ours are visiting us next week from the USA and we are going to bring them to see the park, too!<br><br>
&emsp;  In this theme park it really is a 'small world'!</div>
