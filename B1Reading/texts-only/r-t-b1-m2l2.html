Some students are walking through the museum together with a museum guide. They have just stopped in front of the painting 'The Meeting of Alexander the Great and Diogenes'. The students are very curious about it.

  <table>
<tr><th>Andrew:</th><td>Excuse me, but what is so important about this 'meeting'?</td></tr>
<tr><th>Guide:</th><td>Well, that's an interesting question. You probably know Alexander the Great, but do you know who Diogenes was?</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Andrew:</th><td>Hmm ..</td></tr>
<tr><th>Theresa:</th><td>I know! Wasn't Diogenes the philosopher who the ancient Athenians called the 'dog'?</td></tr>
<tr><th>Guide:</th><td>That's right. And do you also know why they called him that?</td></tr>
<tr><th>Theresa:</th><td>Well, I think it has something to do with the fact that Diogenes admired dogs.</td></tr>
<tr><th>Guide:</th><td>Exactly. He believed that human beings shouldn't live their lives in luxury.  And he also thought that people could learn a lot from dogs because they aren't <mark> fussy </mark> about where they sleep, they eat anything and they know how to tell their friends from their enemies. So, can any of you guess what is so important about this meeting?</td></tr>
<tr><th>Theresa:</th><td>Is Diogenes asking Alexander for something, maybe?<tr><th>Guide:</th><td>Almost. You see, Alexander was a powerful man who many people <mark> feared </mark>. He was also very <mark> wealthy </mark>. Diogenes, who lived in a tub, was only a poor philosopher. His only <mark> possession </mark> was a lamp, which he carried around during the day; he claimed he was looking for an honest man. In this meeting, Alexander says to Diogenes: 'Ask of me anything you like, and you will have it!' What do you think his <mark> response </mark> was?<br>
<tr><th>Luke:</th><td>A new tub!</td></tr>
<tr><th>Guide:</th><td>No, but close. Diogenes was sunning himself at the time. He simply says to Alexander, who is now blocking the sun: 'Stand out of my sunlight!'</td></tr>
