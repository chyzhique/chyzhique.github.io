I got married last June and I wanted everything to be perfect during the <mark> ceremony </mark> . So, when my maid of honour reminded me about the ‘something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue’ tradition, I went hysterical. I had totally forgotten about that! I was running around asking people for things I could use. In the end, I didn’t find ‘my something blue’. But as I was starting to walk down the <mark> aisle </mark> , an usher ran into me and his blue pen exploded all over my dress! I ruined my dress, of course, but at least I had my ‘something blue’. So much for the perfect wedding!

A few days ago, I did something really horrible: I broke a mirror in my bedroom. I didn't want to have seven years of bad luck, so I went on the Net and tried to find a way to break the ' <mark> curse </mark> '. Let me tell you, there are some pretty crazy solutions out there. Some people <mark> swear by </mark> burying the pieces of the mirror in the ground, burning them with a match, or even taking the pieces to a graveyard! After reading all this, I found out something else about myself. I am not only superstitious, but I'm also lazy! I <mark> couldn't be bothered </mark> to do any of those things.

When we were kids, my brother and I used to make wishes on the turkey wishbone every year on Thanksgiving and Christmas. I don't do that anymore as an adult, but my brother is superstitious that he <mark> can't help </mark> doing it. He not only breaks the wishbone of turkey on Thanksgiving, he even does it when he eats chicken! My brother loves chicken, so he does this wishbone thing all the time. His friends think he's crazy, and sometimes I have to agree. How can anyone think that you can make a wish on a chicken bone?

 I wouldn't really consider myself a superstitious person, but there is one thing that I make a habit of doing, and that's knocking on wood. You know, when you say something like 'I've never had a cavity before,' and then you knock on wood. Well, I always do that, except yesterday, that is. I was talking to a friend about car accidents and I mentioned that I had never had one before. Well, wouldn't you know it, this morning, I crashed into a tree! Perhaps if I had remembered to knock on wood, I would have avoided the tree!
