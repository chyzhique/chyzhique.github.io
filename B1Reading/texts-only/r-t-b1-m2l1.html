When King Richard I, the King of England, is sent to prison in Austria, his evil brother, Prince John, decides to take his place. The brave knight, Ivanhoe, who has been at war for several years, returns to England only to discover that the woman he loves, the beautiful Lady Rowena, is going to marry Prince John. Because Ivanhoe is a supporter of King Richard, he spends his time in England in disguise. He decides to call himself ‘the unknown knight’ and takes part in a jousting competition, (jousting is similar to sword-fighting, but the participants are on horses), in order to defeat Prince John’s knights and win back the woman he loves. <hr>
</blockquote>

 A large crowd was gathering at the jousting field when Prince John and Lady Rowena finally arrived. Some of the spectators clapped as the couple walked past them, but many of them looked away. Prince John was not a popular man, and most of the spectators were there to watch the 'unknown knight' defeat the Prince's men.
<br><br>
At one o'clock, Prince John's knights rode onto the field. The men were lining up to greet the Prince when Ivanhoe appeared on his horse. The crowd started clapping as he <mark> approached </mark> the field; some spectators were hoping to see the knight's face, but it was hidden by his helmet.
<br><br>
'Let the competition begin!' shouted Prince John.
<br><br>
One by one, the Prince's men <mark> galloped </mark> towards Ivanhoe with their swords raised. Ivanhoe lifted his shield in the air to protect himself, and used his own sword to knock the knights off their horses. Prince John was watching in shock, while the crowd was cheering wildly.
 <br><br>
'Who is this man?' he whispered to Rowena.
<br><br>
'I don't know,' answered Rowena.
<br><br>
Half an hour later, Prince John <mark> announced </mark> that the unknown knight was the winner of the competition. 'Congratulations,' said Prince John, as he shook Ivanhoe's hand. 'Lady Rowena will give you your medal.'
<br><br>
Ivanhoe <mark> nodded </mark> and knelt down before Rowena.
<br><br>
'Congratulations, unknown knight,' said Rowena. 'Please take your helmet off, I'd like to see your face.'
<br><br>
'So would I,' said Prince John.
<br><br>
Ivanhoe shook his head.
<br><br>
Rowena was preparing to give Ivanhoe his medal when Prince John told his soldiers to remove the knight's helmet. When she saw Ivanhoe's face, she couldn't believe her eyes.
<br><br>
'You!' shouted Prince John.
<br><br>
But Ivanhoe said nothing and fell to the ground in pain. When the Prince's soldiers <mark> removed </mark> Ivanhoe's armour, they saw that blood was pouring from his side. The knight was <mark> wounded </mark>.
