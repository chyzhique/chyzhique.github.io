  <h1>SUPER MUM <br>SAVES CHILD</h1>
  
In one incredible story, Amy Clemens saved her four-year-old child after he got stuck under the fridge. 'When the earthquake began,' Ms Nemens told reporters, 'the fridge started shaking. The tremors quickly increased, and the fridge shook more and more violently. Suddenly, it fell over and Tommy got stuck under it. I could see that he couldn't breathe! The fridge was so heavy I don't know how I did it. I wasn't thinking. I just lifted it with all my strength, and he <mark> crawled </mark> out.' Did this mother have super powers of strength? It seems that her love for her child was her strength.

<h1>LONE MAN SURVIVES CRASH UNHARMED</h1>

 'Like a cat with nine lives' is what people say about Harold Adams who survived a terrible train crash and walked away the only survivor. What's more surprising than that is the fact that He got off the train completely <mark> unharmed </mark>. 'I never <mark> bruised </mark> very easily,' he said when he was asked about how he survived. 'At first, the train wasn't moving very fast, but then it started going faster. When it reached top speed, it was the fastest train I have ever been on. The crash came without warning.' His wife was as astonished as everyone else. 'Harold is like a cat with nine lives,' she said with a smile. 'He has eight more lives left to live! ' Was Harold Adams a super hero? In this case, he was just very lucky.

<h1>CLIMBERS SURVIVE THE WORST</h1>

In a recent report, one climber rescued his friend after the worst avalanche in history. 'At first we were climbing, and then suddenly we were buried under ten feet of thick snow,' said climber Marvin Bailey. 'It was as dark as night. My legs were so <mark> numb </mark> from the cold that I couldn't feel them. But I kept calm and l began to dig myself out of the snow. When I finally reached the top, I searched for and found John. He was unconscious when I pulled him out. He was as white as a sheet, but, fortunately, he was still alive. That was the most frightening moment of my <mark> entire </mark> life.' Was it his courage and determination that made Marvin Bailey a hero? Perhaps it was just his desire to live and to help a friend which freed him from the snow.
