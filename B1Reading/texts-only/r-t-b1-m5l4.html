<h1> <center> HUNGRY BURGLAR CAUGHT RED-HANDED</center></h1>

&emsp; Last night, the police finally caught the well-known  'hungry' burglar in action in the house of Barbara  Fitzpatrick, a Montville, New Jersey native. The burglar  was known in the area for breaking into houses when the  owners were either gone or asleep, and simply eating or taking whatever food he could find. Many victims simply  woke up or returned home to find their cupboards and  fridges completely empty.
<br>
&emsp; That was not the case for Barbara, however. She was asleep  when she heard strange noises coming from the kitchen. She quietly went downstairs and saw a chubby man, of  about 40, eating her chicken leftovers. She immediately called the police and asked them to come to her house as  quickly as possible. The police told her not to panic and  said that they would be there in <mark >no time </mark > . They also told her to stay in her room for safety reasons. 
<br>
&emsp; 'I had heard stories of the hungry thief from friends  and some neighbours who had been victims of his food  raiding, so I was prepared,' Barbara says. ' <mark > Thankfully </mark > , the police arrived before the thief had time to finish my roast chicken. They also found about ten bags of food he was  ready to take with him before he left.  People like Tim and Miranda Jones were not so lucky. They returned home once to find one of their front windows broken and their kitchen a mess. They said that  it looked like a hurricane had passed through their house. There were scraps of food everywhere and pots and pans <mark > scattered </mark > on the floor. 'It was very <mark > bizarre </mark > ,' says Miranda. The police asked us if anything else was missing. We  checked to see if our money and jewellery were gone, but  they were <mark > intact </mark > . It was just the food he was after. We asked our neighbours if they had heard or seen anything but nobody had. I had never <mark > encountered </mark > anything like this. We simply didn't know how to react.'  
<br>
&emsp;  The police confirmed the identification of the man by matching his fingerprints with some that had been left on food containers from his previous burglaries. After  the burglar <mark > confessed </mark > , the police asked him why he had  committed those crimes. He said that he was a homeless man who was simply hungry and preferred eating home cooked meals to stealing from supermarkets. He also said  that he never stole anything <mark > apart from </mark > food. He was charged with burglary and can face up to two years in  prison.
