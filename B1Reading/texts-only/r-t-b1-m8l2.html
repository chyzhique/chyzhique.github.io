<td>Hey, Mary. What's wrong? You look a bit down in the dumps.</td></tr><tr>
<th>Mary</th>
<td>That's because I am. I went to the doctor yesterday, and he weighed me as part of my routine <mark> check-up </mark> . I've gained 15 pounds since my last visit six months ago!</td></tr><tr>
<th>Lisa</th>
<td>I'm sorry to hear that. But it doesn't show if that makes you feel any better.</td></tr><tr>
<th>Mary</th>
<td>Thanks. If only I had been more careful with my eating habits! Anyway, there's no point in sitting around and <mark> moping </mark> . I have to focus on <mark> shedding </mark> these extra pounds.</td></tr><tr>
<th>Lisa</th>
<td>Don't worry; it will be a piece of cake. Once, when I wanted to lose ten pounds, I ate only one meal a day and I exercised a lot. I lost ten pounds in less than a month.</td></tr><tr>
<th>Mary</th>
<td>Well, I don't want to <mark> starve </mark> myself. My doctor told me I should eat four small meals a day and avoid sugar. Unfortunately, he also told me to exercise three or four days a week. I hate exercising! I wish I could lose weight without doing anything.</td></tr><tr>
<th>Lisa</th>
<td>Perhaps you can take some weight-loss supplements to <mark> speed up </mark> your metabolism. My cousin Julie took them and Jost eight pounds in two weeks!</td></tr><tr>
<th>Mary</th>
<td>Yeah, I know these slim quick diet pills are all the rage, but my doctor strongly advised me against using weight-loss supplements. He said some of them could be extremely dangerous. Plus, when you stop taking them, you just gain back all of the weight you lost.</td></tr><tr>
<th>Lisa</th>
<td>Yeah, I guess you're right. My cousin did gain back all of the weight she lost when she stopped taking the pills.</td></tr><tr>
<th>Mary</th>
<td>If only losing weight was as quick and easy as you say, but it looks like it's a <mark> process </mark> that needs to be done right.</td></tr><tr>
<th>Lisa</th>
<td>To tell you the truth, the ten pounds I lost did not stay off long after I stopped exercising and started eating normally again. I guess I should try losing weight the healthy way. We can do it together!</td></tr>
