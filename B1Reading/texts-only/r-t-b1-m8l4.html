&emsp;Telepathy is the ability to communicate with someone else by using your mind. The communication could include anything from transferring thoughts, feelings or other kinds of information. There are three groups that are thought to have telepathic abilities: dogs and their owners, a mother and her newborn baby and identical twins. Of these groups, twins have the strongest telepathic connection. Scientists believe that this is true because identical twins share the same brain waves, which allows both of them to experience and feel things at the same time, even when they are not in the same place.<br>
&emsp; Many studies have been done <mark> regarding </mark> the phenomena of the twin psychic connection, but a 2003 study that took place in a London TV studio puts to rest many doubts people may have of the existence of twin telepathy. Eight-year-old Damien and Richard Powles sat in separate soundproof rooms in the studio. Richard was told to roll up his sleeve and put his arm into a bucket of ice water. He gasped from the shock of the cold. Meanwhile, Damien, who was in his room and <mark> unaware </mark> of what was happening to his brother, also gasped at the same time. Damien was <mark> attached </mark> to a polygraph machine, which <mark> monitored </mark> his breathing, stomach muscles, pulse and the amount of sweat on the palms of his hands. Professional polygrapher Jeremy Barrett was recording the results and analysing them. Neither Damien nor Barrett knew what was going on in the other room at any time during the experiment. In the next experiment, Richard was asked to open a cardboard box placed in front of him. Instead of something pleasant like chocolate in the box, a plastic snake jumped out at him, frightening him. Barrett said that at the exact moment, Damien showed signs of distress through his heart rate and pulse line.
<br>
&emsp;There are many other stories of instances like this between twins. Two young girls, one at a party at another house and one at home, are a good example. The young girl that was at home burnt her hand. At the same moment, the other girl at the party developed the same kind of blister in the exact same spot on her hand as her sister. Another example is a man who collapsed in a chair, <mark> clutching </mark> his chest in pain at the exact moment his twin brother was shot in the chest more than 30 miles away. There may never be <mark> definitive </mark> proof that all identical twins have telepathic powers, but there is enough evidence to suggest that this kind of psychic connection is possible.
