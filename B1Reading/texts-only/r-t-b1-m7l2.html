<td>Hello, Sally. What are you up to?</td></tr><tr>
<th>Sally: </th>
<td>Louise! Is that you! What happened?</td></tr><tr>
<th>Louise:</th>
<td>You ... You look so different! What have you done?</td></tr><tr>
<th>Sally: </th>
<td>I had a complete makeover done. Do you like it?</td></tr><tr>
<th>Louise:</th>
<td>Of course, you look absolutely <mark> gorgeous </mark> !</td></tr><tr>
<th>Sally: </th>
<td>Thank you. Well, it happened last month. I entered my mum for a makeover competition. I had to write to a magazine and say why I thought she needed a makeover. I told them that she hadn't changed her hairstyle in twenty years, that she always wore awful black cardigans and that her false teeth were far too big for her mouth. I also sent in her picture. I guess when they had a look at it, they thought she really needed a makeover!</td></tr><tr>
<th>Louise:</th>
<td>But you got one too, right?</td></tr><tr>
<th>Sally:</th>
<td>Yes, isn't it great? After they finished with my mum, they gave me a makeover. I had my hair and make-up done, and a fashion stylist <mark> picked out </mark> some trendy clothes and accessories for me - I like this new bag and this jewellery.</td></tr><tr>
<th>Louise:</th>
<td>You look amazing. I don't think I've ever seen you in a skirt before. And those boots are fabulous. I love the necklace too; it's pretty and it <mark> matches </mark> your blouse.</td></tr><tr>
<th>Sally:</th>
<td>If you think I look good, you should see my mum. She had her hair cut and styled. Then she had a <mark> facial </mark> done to clear up her skin. A dietician looked at her diet and recommended certain healthy foods. She had some elegant clothes chosen for her and she was given a fitness programme to help keep her <mark> in shape </mark> . The best thing is that she had her teeth done as well. When the curtain was pulled back and I saw my mum, I didn't recognise her.</td></tr><tr>
<th>Mrs Myers: </th>
<td>Hello, girls. What are you talking about?</td></tr><tr>
<th>Sally: </th>
<td>Mrs Myers! You look fantastic! You look about ten years younger!</td></tr><tr>
<th>Mrs Myers: </th>
<td>Oh, thank you. I feel wonderful</td></tr>
