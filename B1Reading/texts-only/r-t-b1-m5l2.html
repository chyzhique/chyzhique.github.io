<th>Jamie:</th>
<td>I didn't get one ... I think.</td></tr><tr>

<td>You think?</td></tr><tr>
<th>Jamie:</th>
<td>Well, I... I can't talk about it. You're only going to think I'm crazy.</td></tr><tr>

<td>No, come on. I'm your friend, remember? You can tell me anything.</td></tr><tr>
<th>Jamie:</th>
<td> OK, so here's how the story goes. Last weekend, I decided to visit my grandparents who live in a very <mark> remote </mark> village. Unfortunately, my car overheated a few miles outside the village so I called up my grandfather, told him what happened and he said he would pick me up in five minutes. While I was waiting for him, I looked up in the sky and saw these really bright lights moving from left to right across the sky.</td></tr><tr>
<th>Katie:</td>
<td>Were they falling stars?</td></tr><tr>
<th>Jamie:</th> 
<td> No, they weren't and I don't know why, but I felt really frightened. I called my grandfather again to see what was taking him so long. He said that he had arrived just minutes after I had called him the first time, but I had been nowhere in sight.</td></tr><tr>
<th>Katie:</th>
<td>Did you <mark> wander off </mark> ?</td></tr><tr>
<th>Jamie:</th>
<td>I never left that <mark> spot </mark> .</td></tr><tr>
<th>Katie:</th>
<td>That's really strange</td></tr><tr>
<th>Jamie:</th>
<td>It gets even stranger. When I went to bed that night, I dreamt that there were these <mark> odd-looking </mark> creatures operating on me. I was terrified, but they kept telling me that I was going to be all right.</td></tr><tr>
<th>Katie:</th> 
<td>Do you think you were kidnapped by aliens while you were waiting for your grandfather?</td></tr><tr>
<th>Jamie:</th> 
<td> I don't know what to believe. But when I went to the hospital yesterday for my operation, the doctor who examined me said my knee seemed perfectly fine and I didn't need an operation after all!</td></tr><tr>
<th>Katie:</th> 
<td>You're kidding!</td></tr><tr>
<th>Jamie:</th> 
<td>No, I'm not! </td></tr><tr>
<th>Katie:</th>
<td>Miracle? Coincidence? Whatever it is, it's definitely strange!</td></tr>
