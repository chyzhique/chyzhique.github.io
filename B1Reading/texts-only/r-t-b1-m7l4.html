&emsp; On a recent trip to London, I decided to visit some exciting new restaurants that are using technology to change the way people dine out. My first stop was at an Italian restaurant in the city centre. 
  <input type="text" id="wordInput1" class="changeDiv" id="changeDiv1" style="width: 5%">
  The manager must have noticed my confusion because he came up to me and explained that I could swipe my card at any of the food and drink stations in the restaurant, and that the card would record my order. No waiters necessary! I made my <mark> selection </mark> and then <mark> handed </mark> my card to the cashier.
  <input type="text" id="wordInput2" class="changeDiv" id="changeDiv2" style="width: 5%">
  My pasta was absolutely delicious, but, I must admit, I didn't enjoy having to carry my food up two flights of stairs!
<br><br>
&emsp; <input type="text" id="wordInput3" class="changeDiv" id="changeDiv3" style="width: 5%"> When we arrived, I was surprised to discover that there were no paper menus; instead, the menus were beamed on to the touch screen surface of the table with projectors. All we had to do was <mark> tap </mark> on our choices with our fingers and wait for the waiters to bring us our meal. 
  <input type="text" id="wordInput4" class="changeDiv" id="changeDiv4" style="width: 5%">
  We had so much fun playing games that we hardly touched our food when it arrived - we really should have told the waiter to give us takeaways instead! 
<br><br>
&emsp; Another restaurant that I visited in London was an Indian restaurant. This restaurant also had touch screen tabletops, as well as another very interesting feature: a webcam which allowed me to see the cooks preparing the food in the kitchen! 
  <input type="text" id="wordInput5" class="changeDiv" id="changeDiv5" style="width: 5%">
  I really enjoyed the evening, but I shouldn't have ordered the extra-spicy curry - it was a little too hot for me!<br><br>
&emsp; On my last day in London, I decided to get some tapas from a Spanish takeaway near my hotel. I had heard that the owners had installed a webcam at the restaurant to allow their customers to <mark> view </mark> the long lunchtime <mark> queue </mark> online. 
  <input type="text" id="wordInput6" class="changeDiv" id="changeDiv6" style="width: 5%">
  While I packed my <mark> baggage </mark> , I kept an eye on the queue and then <mark> raced </mark> to the restaurant when the lunchtime rush was over. Without that wonderful webcam, I could have missed my plane! 
<br><br>
&emsp; I really can't wait for my next trip to London - high-tech dining is such fun.
