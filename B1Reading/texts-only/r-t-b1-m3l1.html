<h1>Elizabeth <br>(18 years old)</h1>
I'm what you call a <mark> bookworm </mark>. I find nothing more entertaining than staying at home and reading a good book. I read anything from adventure to science fiction. If I start reading a book, I don't put it down until I finish it. My parents are <mark> constantly </mark> complaining that I don't get out much, but I've no <mark> intention </mark> of changing. I've recently started writing and I hope to write a bestseller in the future. I also spend a lot of time surfing the Net. Last week, I <mark> came across </mark> a site for people interested in writing and I became a member. Since then I've had the opportunity to talk to people with similar interests, and it's nice to know that I'm not so out of the ordinary.

My idea of fun is anything that's related to sports. I've always been sporty and athletic and I'm <mark> willing </mark> to try whatever will get my adrenaline going. Unlike many people my age, I don't enjoy going out to cafes. I love doing things that keep me outdoors in the natural environment. I became a member of a rock climbing club about three years ago, and I must admit that I've had a lot of fun. I've met lots of interesting people and I've also been to a lot of interesting places. Besides this, l also find water sports great. I've been windsurfing for ages and I've also recently started taking scuba-diving lessons.

I'm really into surfing the Net and playing strategy games on my computer. I've been playing computer games ever since my father got me my first computer when I was six. When I'm not playing computer games, I <mark> tend to </mark> be out and about. My friends and I spend a lot of time at the local football pitch so, although I'm not so athletic, I do get some exercise. I'm also into hanging out at the local mall where my friends and I either go to the cinema or to a cafe.

<h1>Jenny <br>(19 years old)</h1>
I'm very sociable and hang out at all the 'in' places. I have lots of friends and love meeting people. At the weekends, I usually go somewhere to dance. When l was five, my mother took me to the Contemporary School of Dance and, since then, l have never stopped dancing. I also love music and go to concerts very often. On top of that, I'm a member of a local theatre group, and we put on performances <mark> every once in a while </mark>. We have a lot of fun choosing the plays and rehearsing. Since I joined the group, I've taken part in three different plays. It's not only fun but also very rewarding.
