<th>Receptionist:</th>
<td>Hmm, I'm sorry, Mr Connors but there are no rooms available for that weekend.</td></tr><tr>
<th>Chris:</th>
<td>Oh no! How terrible! But didn't you recently expand the hotel in order to accommodate more guests?</td></tr><tr>
<th>Receptionist:</th>
<td>Well, despite adding an extra wing with 50 more rooms, we have none available. You see, it's a long weekend next weekend and many people have decided to take advantage of our 20% special discount offer. Oh ... hold on a minute, Mr Connors. This is your lucky day! There's a double room available as a reservation has just been cancelled.</td></tr><tr>
<th>Chris:</th>
<td>That's wonderful! Please book the room for me.</td></tr><tr>
