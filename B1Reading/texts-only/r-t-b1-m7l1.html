&emsp; Today, many computer experts claim that traditional language learning methods used in classrooms will gradually be replaced by newer methods. Some of these new methods include e-learning, attending virtual classrooms, using tandem e-mail and using interactive CDs. <hr>
&emsp; E-learning is short for electronic learning and, as the name suggests, it means any kind of learning environment which is electronic. On the Internet there are <mark> countless </mark> sites dedicated to language learning. These include worksheets you can download, interactive games, puzzles, quizzes and so on. <br>
&emsp; It is also claimed that a day may come when we will no longer have to go to class. Instead, we will sit in front of the computer, log on from home, and 'meet' our teacher and other learners in a 'virtual' classroom. Although this type of learning environment is quite similar to the traditional classroom, it makes the learner far more independent and <mark> flexible </mark> . The teacher, or moderator, encourages the language learner to analyse what and how he or she wants to learn and then helps him or her to achieve those ends. Virtual classrooms can use all the online resources available and usually use a type of chat room to practise oral communication.<br>
&emsp; Another new method of language learning is tandem e-mail. Tandem learning means learning with a partner who is a native speaker of the language you are learning, but who is also learning your native language. In tandem e-mail, you and your partner exchange emails written half in one language and half in the other. In this way, both you and your partner are reading and writing in the 'foreign' language. Tandem e-mail exchanges provide a very fast, immediate way of communicating. It is 'real' communication with a partner who is about the same age and may have the same interests. <br>
&emsp; Finally, there are interactive language learning CDs which offer a <mark> range </mark> of benefits. Learners can work at their own speed and can repeat vocabulary and phrases as often as they wish. Conversations are spoken by native speakers, which helps with pronunciation. CDs use a range of media; short film clips of typical scenes and situations, music, interactive quizzes and much more. <br>
&emsp; So are the days of the traditional classroom numbered? Will the teacher be unnecessary? It is unlikely. However, the new media will play an increasingly important part in all learning and will <mark> complement </mark> traditional English teaching rather than <mark> replace </mark> it entirely.
