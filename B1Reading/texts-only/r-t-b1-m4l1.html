The world is experiencing a time of change. We are moving from a 'grey' economy, based on habits that are harmful to the environment, to a 'green' economy, based on the understanding that we need to protect our environment. How will future generations meet these challenges? Volunteers are needed for the Global Youth for Environmental Protection (GYEP) agency. You will help to train young and interested high school students while they prepare themselves for the green jobs of the future. Join today and help shape the minds of tomorrow!
