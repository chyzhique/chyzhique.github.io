<h2>Q: HOW OLD ARE THEY?</h2>

âš« Bruce Wayne (Batman), is a handsome, tall, slim, 34-year-old billionaire. But is he actually 34 years old? Well, the first Batman appeared in comics in 1939.<br> 
ðŸ”´ Superman's secret identity is Clark Kent. His first appearance as Superman was in 1938, at around the age of thirty.</p>
<h2>Q: WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG?</h2>
âš« At the age of 14, Bruce Wayne was in Europe. He spent some time at Cambridge University, at the Sorbonne in Paris, at Berlin School of Science and the other schools. At the age of 20, he joined the FBI for six weeks, but he soon realised how boring that job was for him.<br>
ðŸ”´ As a child Clark lived in Smallville. Together with his foster parents, he discovered his superpowers and soon became Superboy. He started fighting crime. After his parents' death in 1938, he moved to Metropolis and went to Metropolis University. During those years, he changed his name to Superman.</p>
<h2>Q: WHAT ARE THEY LIKE?</h2>
âš« Batman, just like his alter ego, Bruce Wayne, likes working alone, he never trusts people and he is devoted to what he does, fighting crime.<br>
ðŸ”´ Superman isn't shy like Clark Kent. He is a peace maker and he has great self-control.</p>
