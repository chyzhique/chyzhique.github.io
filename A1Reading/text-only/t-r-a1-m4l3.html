Dear Angela,
<br><br>
I have some good news. I'm officially a member of the 'Get involved' volunteer organisation. Let me tell you all about it.<br><br>
'Get involved' helps orphans around the world. Volunteers visit different orphanages, they organise events to raise money, they have workshops, <mark>they</mark> even help build new schools in poor countries. This year about 20 volunteers are going to Nepal for ten days and I'm going with <mark>them</mark>. Can you believe it?
<br><br>
We need to work really hard to have everything ready, but I'm really excited about going <mark>there</mark>. I'm doing the art workshop and I'm trying to find some interesting
activities for the children. Any ideas? Another volunteer, Kelly, is organising the
street puppet show. Maybe I can work with <mark>her.</mark><br><br>
That's all for now. See you when I get back. Wish me luck!<br><br>
Take care,<br>
Beth
