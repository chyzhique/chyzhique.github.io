Every year, on the last Monday of May, the people of 'Grockworth, in Gloucestershire, England, organise quite an unusual event: the Cooper Hill Cheese Rolling.
<br><br>
This event is at least 200 years old. People chase a round block of cheese down a deep hill. The aim is to catch the rolling cheese. It's not easy and this rarely happens because the cheese moves at a speed of 70mph. So, the winner is the first person to cross the finish line at the bottom of the hill. There are cheese rolling races for all ages - so everybody can take part.
<br><br>
All you have to do is stand at the top of the hill, wait for the command and be quick and careful, because you can end up rolling downhill just like the cheese. Seems dangerous? Well, competitors and even spectators can get injured during the races, so there are paramedics everywhere, at the top and bottom of the hill. For something a bit safer, try the uphill race. In this race, all competitors just run up the hill.
<br><br>
The winners of all the races get a cheese as a prize. The competitors in second and third place receive a small amount of money (adults: £10 - £5 / children: £5).
So? Are you a daredevil? Just remember! Choose the right footwear and join in the fun!
