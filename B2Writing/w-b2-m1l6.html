  Have you ever stood on the summit of a volcano? Can you imagine yourself standing on one in France? In
the Auvergne volcanic region, one of the most beautiful regions in France, you can experience the unique volcanic
landscape and much more.
Last year I visited the region and on the first day, I climbed the Puy de Dôme - a dormant volcanic peak. The view from
the top was simply breathtaking; the sky was bright blue and all around I saw mountain chains, rolling green hills,
golden wheat fields and the sparkling city of Clermond-Ferrand.
The volcanoes aren't the only attraction, however. There are many other interesting places to see, including the elegant
spa town of Vichy with its therapeutic waters. Here you can relax, become fit and get a new lease of life. But what I really
enjoyed most was walking around the town, admiring the architecture and browsing in the antique shops.
