  Dear Mario,<br>
&emsp; How are you? I'm really excited that you're coming to stay with me in Manchester. I have received the arrival details that you sent me and I will be 
  <span class="tooltip" style="text-decoration-line: underline; text-decoration-style: solid; text-decoration-color: blue;"><span class="tooltiptext">thank and say how I feel</span>
    picking you up from the airport on Saturday 10th May.</span><br>
&emsp; I have planned lots of things for us to do. I suggest we take a trip to the Lake District, which is a beautiful area in England, full of lakes and countryside which is great for hiking through. Something else, my dad is a season ticket holder for Manchester
United and I've managed to get tickets for a match. 
  <span class="tooltip" style="text-decoration-line: underline; text-decoration-style: solid; text-decoration-color: blue;"><span class="tooltiptext">great! because...</span>
    What do you think?</span><br>
&emsp; Also, we have the option of spending a weekend in London or in Edinburgh as I have relatives in both cities who would be happy to put us up for a few nights. Let me know 
  <span class="tooltip" style="text-decoration-line: underline; text-decoration-style: solid; text-decoration-color: blue;"><span class="tooltiptext">say which and why</span>
    which city you would prefer to visit.</span>
  I was wondering if you could arrange to
stay in England for one more week so we could go to 
  <span class="tooltip" style="text-decoration-line: underline; text-decoration-style: solid; text-decoration-color: blue;"><span class="tooltiptext"> no because</span>
    other exciting places.</span><br>
&emsp; I'm looking forward to seeing you soon. I hope you can make it and stay a bit longer!<br>
All the best,<br>
Peter

<h3>B. Now read Mario's reply and answer the questions that follow.</h3>
  <ol>  
<li>Which sentences in the e-mail correspond to Mario's notes?
<li>Is the wording in Mario's e-mail exactly the same as in his notes?
<li>Does Mario add any extra comments or information to his notes?
<li>What kind of language does Mario use?
  </ol>
<h3>3. FOCUS ON COMMUNICATION FUNCTIONS</h3>
<h5>Read the tip below and then make up an
appropriate response for each prompt.
Remember to add a piece of information
or a personal comment.</h5>
<div class="hint">
The notes that accompany a letter or an
e-mail used as input require you to express
certain functions, e.g. express enthusiasm,
thank, apologise, explain, accept or decline
an invitation, etc. When writing your reply,
do not just copy the notes given. Try to
paraphrase, add reasons, comments and/or
information and use expressions to show how
you feel.</div>

Dear Peter,<br>
&emsp; How are you? I hope you are well. Thank you for offering to pick me up from the airport. I can't wait to come
to Manchester. This trip is going to be a great opportunity for me to practise my English and learn more about
England.<br>
&emsp; A trip to the Lake District sounds great. I've heard loads of nice things about it and I enjoy hiking. It's fantastic
that you can get tickets to a Manchester United match. I love football and Manchester United is one of my
favourite teams, so I'm really looking forward to going to one of their matches.<br>
&emsp; As for the weekend option, I've been to London before but I've never been to Edinburgh, so I think I would
prefer to go there if that's possible. Unfortunately, I won't be able to stay for an extra week with you because
I've already planned a camping holiday with my cousins for the end of May.<br>
&emsp; Anyway, I'm sure we'll have a great time together. Say hello to everyone in your family.<br><br>
Best wishes,<br>
Mario
