&emsp; With fall approaching, the evenings were getting colder. Two men were talking by a river. One of them had dark skin and his body was painted with different colors. He had a shaved head, apart from a crest down
the middle and his name was Chingachgook. He wore buckskin pants and he held a tomahawk and a <mark>rifle</mark>. The other man was of European origin, but his skin was dark from the sun. He was dressed like a Native American too, and had a rifle-of great length. Chingachgook was telling him stories of his fathers, who were proud <mark>warriors</mark> before the white men came from the setting sun.<br>
&emsp; 'l wish there were more of my people. But when I die, my son Uncas, will be the last of the Mohicans,' said Chingachgook.<br>
&emsp; 'Uncas is here!' said another voice, and a young warrior came and sat with them. The father showed no surprise and they all sat silently for several minutes.<br>
'Did you see any of those <mark>thieves</mark> from the Maquas tribe?' asked Chingachgook.<br>
&emsp; 'I have been on their <mark>trail</mark>, and there are as many as the fingers on both my hands. But they hide like cowards!' replied his son.

   <div class="column">
&emsp; Chingacbgook turned to his friend and said: "Hawkeye, let us eat well tonight and show those Maquas that we are men tomorrow.'<br>
lt was not long before they heard an animal moving in the <mark>bushes</mark>. Hawkeye raised his rifle, but Uncas whispered to him.<br>
&emsp; 'If l were you, I wouldn't shoot. The Maquas will hear. Those thieves would want to eat too if you killed the animal.'<br>
&emsp; Hawkeye put his rifle down and watched as Uncas threw himself to the ground and moved silently towards his prey. Soon enough, there was an arrow in its side. The <mark>wounded</mark> animal jumped out of the bushes and Uncas finished the job with his knife.<br>
&emsp; 'Shhhh! I bear something,' said Chingachgook.<br>
&emsp; 'Maybe it's wolves following the animal,' suggested Hawkeye.<br>
&emsp; 'No. The horses of white men are coming. Hawkeye, they are your brothers, speak to them. With the Maquas nearby, this is a dangerous place for them,' said Chingachgook.
