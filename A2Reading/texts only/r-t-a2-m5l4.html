  <h1 class="header">Train Derailed by Sheep!</h1>

  <i>THE DAILY NEWS / Friday 1 November</i></h5>

An InterCity train was derailed in South Wales yesterday. The train was travelling through a tunnel
at 160 kilometres per hour when it hit a flock of sheep that was going in the opposite direction. The train
came off the tracks, fell onto its side and skidded for another 200 metres before coming to a stop.
Fortunately, nobody was killed, but 28 people were injured, 5 of them seriously.
<br><br>
The police, fire crews and the ambulance service were all called immediately and they arrived within
minutes to rescue the people. The injured passengers were taken to local hospitals. 'It's a miracle that it was
not a greater tragedy,' said Steven Jones, one of the firefighters. 'When we arrived, smoke was coming out
of the tunnel and we thought that the train was on fire. A fire in a tunnel is of course a very serious matter, but
luckily it was only the engine and we put it out very quickly.'
<br><br>
Amazingly, the train driver was not hurt in the accident. He said later: 'As soon as I noticed the
animals, I pulled the emergency brake, but it was too late.' The tunnel was damaged and the train
was almost completely destroyed. Overall, 2 million pounds of damage was caused.
<br><br>
All the sheep except one died in the crash. The lucky survivor was rescued by a police officer and is now
called Lucky Lucy. The local farmer who owned the sheep has no idea how the accident happened. 'I have
lots of sheep and they are kept in a nearby field which is surrounded by a fence. I don't know how these sheep
got out.' How this accident happened is a mystery.
