You will arrive in Ensenada and from there you'll travel by boat to Guadalupe Island, one of the best places in
the world to see great white sharks. You'll spend the first two nights of your trip on the boat and you will
have the opportunity to eat some traditional Mexican food. In the afternoon, you'll watch a diving safety video. If there's time, your guides might take you to see the famous Guadalupe fur seals.

<h2 style="float:left; background-color:#C51605; padding:1rem; margin:1rem; text-align:center; color:white">DAY <br>2</h2>
There are five shark cages on the boat and they will be open for diving at 6am, so if you wake up early, you'll
be able to swim with the sharks before breakfast! You will spend most of the day diving with sharks. But if you
change your mind, you can sit and watch all the action on a 42' TV in the main salon through a special underwater 'shark cam'.

<h2 style="float:left; background-color:#C51605; padding:1rem; margin:1rem; text-align:center; color:white">DAY <br>3</h2>
You will arrive in Cancun early in the morning. After checking into the hotel, you will spend the rest
of the day taking part in some exciting extreme sports. Activities on offer include bungee jumping and 
windsurfing. You'll also be able to go parasailing if it's not too windy.

<h2 style="float:left; background-color:#C51605; padding:1rem; margin:1rem; text-align:center; color:white">DAY <br>4</h2>
During your second day in Cancun, you'll get the chance to go sightseeing. You can see fascinating Mayan ruins at the El Rey archaeological site. Also, if you visit the Interactive Aquarium, you'll have the
opportunity to swim with dolphins and touch sea urchins and stingrays. If you want to see more sights, ask your hotel to recommend a tour guide.

You will arrive in Acapulco. When you check into the hotel, a coach will take you to the Papagayo River.
There are a number of sports activities on offer there, including kayaking and rock climbing. Alternatively,
you can ride down the river in a speedboat.

<h2 style="float:left; background-color:#C51605; padding:1rem; margin:1rem; text-align:center; color:white">DAY <br>6</h2>
This is the last day of your trip, so you'll have to get up early for the goodbye gathering. It will take place
in the breakfast area. There will be music, and all participants will receive photos of the trip. You must
check out of the hotel by midday. If you book your taxi to the airport in advance, you'll get a 10% discount.</div></div>
