Clerk </td><td>Good morning, how can I help you?</td></tr><tr><td>
Sean</td><td> ... Where are you?</td></tr><tr><td>
Vicky</td><td> I'm outside the vintage music store with Jay. I've just bought this great jazz compilation.</td></tr><tr><td>
Sean</td><td> Nice! Jay's there, huh? You should play him a few songs from my new alburn on your
phone. He'll like them.</td></tr><tr><td>
Vicky</td><td> OK. See you later.

Jay</th><td>Who was that?</td></tr><tr><th>
Vicky</th><td>It was my brother, Sean.</td></tr><tr><th>
Jay</th><td>I haven't seen him since Gary's party. Is he still in that band?</td></tr><tr><th>
Vicky</th><td> Yes, and he told me I should play you a few songs from his new album.</td></tr><tr><th>
Jay</th><td> Does he have an album out?</td></tr><tr><th>
Vicky</th><td> Well, you can't buy it in the Apple Music, Deezer or anything. But his band went to a proper studio for the recording. It was quite expensive but the end result was great.</td></tr><tr><th>
Jay</th><td>They're becoming quite professional.</td></tr><tr><th>
Vicky</th><td>The studio engineer told them that they were the best he had heard for ages.</td></tr><tr><th>
Jay</th><td>Wow! He's going to be famous.</td></tr><tr><th>
Vicky</th><td>Here, listen to track 3. It's wicked!</td></tr><tr><th>
Jay</th><td>Turn down the volume. It's a bit loud ... That's better. Hmm ... lt has a strong beat. It's like a mixture of rock and hip hop. I like it.</td></tr><tr><th>
Vicky</th><td>He said you would.</td></tr><tr><th>
Jay</th><td>Who writes the lyrics?</td></tr><tr><th>
Vicky</th><td>My brother. He plays the guitar, too.</td></tr><tr><th>
Jay</th><td>The lead singer has a great voice. Listen, I'd love to get a hold of a copy of this album.
</td></tr><tr><th>
Vicky</th><td>I can get you one. I forgot! They have a SoundCloud account where you can download the whole album if you want. </td></tr><tr><th>
Jay</th><td>That sounds good .
