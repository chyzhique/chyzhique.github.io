            I once worked at a sweet factory putting sugar on sweets
and biscuits. I thought it would be nice because I was a
big fan of sweets. Well, I used to go home with sugar in
my hair, up my nose and in my ears! It was disgusting and
the smell was so strong that I couldn't get used to it. I
only lasted a week, but one good thing did come out of
my experience. By the time I left, I had given up sweets
altogether.

I worked for one summer at a safari park. I liked feeding
the penguins and the other animals in general, but cleaning
up after them wasn't much fun, as you can imagine. The
worst job I had was in the monkey reserve. You see, as
visitors drove through, monkeys usually climbed on their
cars for a free ride. At the exit of the reserve, one of us had
to stop the monkeys from getting into the next reserve.
I can tell you, chasing monkeys around with a stick in the
middle of the summer is not fun at all.

My job can be really hard sometimes as it involves taking
customers' orders, answering calls and in general. dealing
with people and their complaints. You see, I work at a call
centre and the things I have to put up with are awful. Just
because people can't see you face-to-face, they think it's OK
to be rude. It was really difficult in the beginning, but by
the end of the first month, I had learnt not to take it too
personally. Once, I got so angry with a customer, I shouted
back at him, and it almost cost me my job.

I often remind myself, no matter how bad things get, they
could be worse. I could still be working there. I don't know
how I lasted a month at the box factory. I'd had enough
before the end of the first week. It was exhausting on the
body, but what it did to your mind was most worrying.
Boring, just isn't a strong enough word. I worked with a
man who had been there for twenty years! He told me he
dreamt of boxes, he saw boxes when he closed his eyes,
and he even tasted boxes when he ate. I was so glad when
I was fired!<br>
