Hello. My name is Mary Smith. I would like to make an appointment with the doctor for today.</td></tr><tr><td>

Today? I'm afraid she's <mark>booked up</mark>, for the day. What about tomorrow morning? <mark>Hang on</mark> a minute, please. Let me check her schedule ... Tomorrow the doctor is available at

Half past ten is more convenient for me.</td></tr></table>
