In the good old days, friends used to phone you or send you a birthday card on your birthday. These days, if you're a member of a social networking website, like Facebook, SnapChat, WeChat, Instagram, you probably receive messages on your 'wall' with a virtual gift or get DMs.<br><br>
SN sites appeared just before the beginning of the century and took the Internet, and the world, by storm.
Just a few decades ago, people wrote letters or called each other <mark>regularly</mark> to keep in touch. Then e-mails came, and today SN sites allow users to communicate <mark>instantly</mark> with friends and family.<br><br>
In the past, people could play computer games with friends only when they were together. With SN sites,
users can play <mark>online</mark> games with people that are next door or on the other side of the world. They can even
play with 'virtual' friends they've never even met. And it seems it doesn't take time to make friends; it just takes a
few clicks of the mouse.<br><br>
Until very recently, people used to put all their holiday photos in albums. Now SN users can <mark>display</mark> their photos online. Just click on your friend's album and enjoy! It's easy to keep in touch with friends online, and making
virtual friends can be great fun. But when it comes to birthdays, real gifts are much better than virtual ones!
