<td>Look! Here's one outside the hotel on our first day.</td></tr><tr>
<td>Fiona </td>
<td>We were tired from the car journey. So, we didn't ride much that day.</td></tr><tr>

<td>But the next day we went on a long ride.</td></tr><tr>
<td>Fiona </td>
<td>Too long. We decided to go to this gorge, but the hills were really steep in that area.</td></tr><tr>
<td>Martin </td>
<td>Fiona was pushing her bike most of the way up.</td></tr><tr>
<td>Fiona </td>
<td>Yes, you weren't helping at all. You were taking pictures of me all the time. Here's one.</td></tr><tr>
<td>Annie</td>
<td>It looks very muddy.</td></tr><tr>
<td>Martin </td>
<td>And that's before the rain. The water came down like a river.</td></tr><tr>

<td style=" padding: 10px">Sounds dangerous.</td></tr>
<td>Martin </td>
<td>No, actually, it was exciting.</td></tr><tr>
<td>Fiona</td>
<td>Yeah, and when we managed to reach the top, we were amazed!</td></tr><tr>
<td>Martin </td>
<td>The view down into the gorge was fantastic!</td></tr><tr>
<td>Annie </td>
<td>Did you take any pictures there?</td></tr><tr>
<td>Martin </td>
<td>Sorry, but with all that rain, the camera got wet and stopped working.</td></tr><tr>
<td>Annie </td>
<td>So, all that effort and no pictures to show for it.</td></tr><tr>
<td>Fiona</td>
<td>I'm afraid so.
