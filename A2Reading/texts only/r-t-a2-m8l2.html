We know what feels normal and right to do in our culture. But other cultures have customs and gestures that are different and they may seem strange to us. So, it's easy to misunderstand someone from a culture that is different from our own.</i>
     
     <h4 class="header">Here are a few examples:</h4>

ðŸ”´ I was in Russia with some friends and we were about to leave to go
on a long trip. So with my bags in my hand, I walked towards the door. I
turned around to say something, but everyone else was Just sitting there
silently. With his finger to his lips, Dimitri smiled at me and asked me not to
interrupt, as this would bring bad luck. Feeling a bit embarrassed, I walked
back in and sat down. After a minute, everyone got up and cheerfully
walked out the door. I later learnt that it is a Russian custom to sit silently
in the house before a iourney. Actually, it's also useful because it helps you
remember if you've forgotten anything important.<br>

ðŸ”´ I'm from Wisconsin, and when we meet someone for the first time, we usually shake hands. Well, I had a big surprise in Belgium. When I was introduced to my friend's brother, something occurred, which made me feel uncomfortable. I said 'hi' to him, extending my hand, and he came up to me and kissed me on the cheek, not once, but three times, going from one cheek to the other! Of course, I went red and they started laughing at me. In Belgium, it's common to greet someone by kissing three times.<br>

ðŸ”´ Last year I was invited to Japan by my friend Daiki. On the second day 
of my visit, Oaiki asked me if I wanted to see his son in a play and of course
I said 'yes' It was really entertaining but halfway through the play, I got something in my eye. So, I tried to remove it with my finger. Daiki's wife saw me and she got really upset. I couldn't understand why though. I asked Daiki why his wife was angry with me and he told me that in Japan when you pull the skin down
under your eye, it shows that you find something boring. Later in the evening, I
apologised to Daiki's wife and tried to clear up the misunderstanding, but I'm not so sure she believed me. <br>
