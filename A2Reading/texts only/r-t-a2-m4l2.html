  <h3 style="margin-bottom:0">'MAN WILL NOT FLY FOR 50 YEARS'</h3> 
   <h5 style="margin-top:0"><i>Wilbur Wright to his brother Orville (1901)</i></h5>

In 1901, the Wright brothers tried out their flying machine for the first time but were very <mark>disappointed</mark> when they didn't <mark>succeed</mark>. However, two years later, in 1903, they took to the skies and entered the history book. And only 18 years after Wilbur made his prediction, Captain John Alcock and Lieutenant Arthur Whitten Brown made the first non-stop transatlanticflight from Newfoundland. CAnada to Ireland.

<h3 style="margin-bottom:0">'I think there's a world market for about five computers.'</h3> 
   <h5 style="margin-top:0"><i>Thomas J. Watson, chairman of the board of IBM (1943)</i></h5>

This prediction seems <mark>ridiculous</mark> today, but it was true for ten years after Watson said it. Even so, today there are about 1 billion computers in use in the world. Experts <mark>predict</mark> there will be 2 billion by 2025.

<h3 style="margin-bottom:0">'Television won't <mark>last</mark> because people will soon get tired of staring at a plywood box every night.'</h3> 
   <h5 style="margin-top:0"><i>Darryl Zanuck, film producer, 20th Century Fox (1946)</i></h5>

Zanuck played a <mark>major</mark> role in the Hollywood studio system from 1922 to 1970, but he definitely got it wrong about television. The total number of TV sets in the world is over 1.5 billion. In the USA, there are over 2000 TV channels and on  average, a TV set is on for 6 hours and 47 minutes every day.

<h3 style="margin-bottom:0">'There's just not that many videos I want to watch.'</h3> 
   <h5 style="margin-top:0"><i>Steve Chen, co-founder of YouTube (2005)</i></h5>
       
<h1>  </h1>

At the time, Chen was worried about the popularity of his site. Luckily for Chen, he continued with his You Tube idea and almost two years later, on 13 November 2006, he made a lot of money when Google bought YouTube for $1.65 billion. Today, You Tube is the Internet's largest video sharing website. People from all around the world watch hundreds of millions of videos every day.
