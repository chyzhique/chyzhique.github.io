Well, up until the late 19th century, scientists explored caves for study. In 1889, Edouard-Alfred Martel used ropes and ladders to go down <mark>vertical</mark> caves over 100m deep because he liked exploration. Today, we call these caves 'potholes' and they are the most popular with cavers.

It's the <mark>thrill</mark> of the unknown and discovering new places.
Sometimes, you have to walk through waist-high water or climb a slippery rock face, and you think, 'What am I doing?' But then you discover a huge underground cave with beautiful rock <mark>formations</mark> and it all seems worth it.
Of course, half the fun is trying to get back out of the cave.

Most caving clubs have special programmes for <mark>beginners</mark>. They must learn the basic skills above ground first. They aren't allowed to take part otherwise. You have to be physically fit for caving and <mark>the minimum</mark> age for
club members is usually 16.

Never explore caves alone, always in groups. And you mustn't go without an experienced caver. Also, it's a 
good idea to leave a note of your trip and the timeyou expect to return with someone. Caving can be dangerous.
It's very easy for accidents to happen, but rescuing people is very difficult, sometimes impossible.

Without light you are lost. So, each person must have a headlamp and at least one extra, as well as batteries. You need some strong ropes and a first-aid kit is necessary, too. You don't have to wear special clothing, as long as what you wear is warm and <mark>waterproof</mark>.
