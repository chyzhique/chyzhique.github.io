Lee</td><td> So, which one do you want to buy?</td></tr><tr><td>
Jack</td><td> It's that one over there.</td></tr><tr><td>
Lee</td><td> It's huge. Where are you going to put it?</td></tr><tr><td>
Jack</td><td> In my living room, right next to the window.</td></tr><tr><td>
Lee</td><td> Does it fit?</td></tr><tr><td>
Jack</td><td> Just about. It's a powerful image, don't you think?</td></tr><tr><td>
Lee</td><td> You're crazy. And why did you bring me here? I don't know anything about art.</td></tr><tr><td>
Jack</td><td> Well, I was getting to that.</td></tr><tr><td>
Lee</td><td> By the way, how much is it?</td></tr><tr><td>
Jack</td><td> Â£7500.</td></tr><tr><td>
Lee</td><td> Are you serious? Can you afford it?</td></tr><tr><td>
Jack</td><td> Not exactly. I'm a bit short. That's why I was thinking ...</td></tr><tr><td>
Lee</td><td> Here we go.</td></tr><tr><td>
Jack</td><td> Will you lend me some money? Not all of it, just half, maybe.</td></tr><tr><td>
Lee</td><td> I can't believe this.</td></tr><tr><td>
Jack</td><td> Oh, please. I'll pay you back at the end of next month.</td></tr><tr><td>
Lee</td><td> I don't know. What is it supposed to be, anyway?</td></tr><tr><td>
Jack</td><td> It's called Life Source.</td></tr><tr><td>
Lee</td><td> It looks like a big egg to me. What a waste of money!</td></tr><tr><td>
Jack</td><td> It's worth buying, trust me.</td></tr><tr><td>
Lee</td><td> Go on then, I'll help you out.</td></tr><tr><td>
Jack</td><td> Fantastic!</td></tr><tr><td>
Lee</td><td> How are you going to get it home?</td></tr><tr><td>
Jack</td><td> As soon as the exhibition is over, they'll deliver it to me.</td></tr><tr><td>
Lee</td><td> And pay more money I expect. Forget it. I'll help you carry it home.</td></tr><tr><td>
Jack</td><td> What?</td></tr><tr><td>
Lee</td><td> I'm only kidding!</td></tr></table>
