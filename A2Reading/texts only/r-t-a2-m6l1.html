Alex</td><td> What's this?</td></tr><tr><td>
Tonia</td><td> A birthday present. Go on, open it. You may need scissors.</td></tr><tr><td>
Alex</td><td> You really didn't need to buy me anything.</td></tr><tr><td>
Tonia</td><td> So, what do you think?</td></tr><tr><td>
Alex</td><td> Ermm ... It's a game console. But I already have one.</td></tr><tr><td>
Tonia</td><td> Not like this one. Come on, open it. It's brilliant. My cousin Frank has one and he plays all day.</td></tr><tr><td>
Alex</td><td> Is it the one with the wireless controller?</td></tr><tr><td>
Tonia</td><td> That's right, here it is. Let me show you. Let's say you're playing a tennis game. You have to swing the controller to hit the ball, like this. Or for bowling, you have to move your arm like this to throw the ball, just like in real bowling.</td></tr><tr><td>
Alex </td><td>But you don't th row the controller, do you?</td></tr><tr><td>
Tonia</td><td> No, it might break. Anyway, it has a wrist strap to stop you from dropping it.</td></tr><tr><td>
Alex</td><td> What about football? How do you pass the ball or shoot?</td></tr><tr><td>
Tonia</td><td> I'm not sure, but I know you can use the controller like a normal game controller.</td></tr><tr><td>
Alex</td><td> Sounds like fun. What games do I have?</td></tr><tr><td>
Tonia</td><td> Well, it comes with lots of sports games. Tennis, baseball, boxing, golf. .. What shall we start with?</td></tr><tr><td>
Alex</td><td> Do you need to ask?</td></tr><tr><td>
Tonia</td><td> Of course, golf, your favourite.</td></tr><tr><td>
Alex</td><td> So, you swing the controller like this to hit the ball.</td></tr><tr><td>
Tonia</td><td> You're a fast learner.</td></tr><tr><td>
Alex</td><td> I'm going to thrash you!</td></tr><tr><td>
Tonia</td><td> I'm quite good at this golf game actually. So, l could beat you.</td></tr><tr><td>
Alex</td><td> Let's see!</td></tr></table>
