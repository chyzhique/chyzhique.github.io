Because big salaries and large bonuses aren't always
enough to keep employees happy, some companies are
now offering their staff exciting and unusual <mark>perks</mark>. A
software company in Los Angeles, USA, for example, has
built a number of on-site facilities for its employees. Staff ,
can visit the hairdresser's, leave their cars at the car wash
and their clothes at the dry-cleaner's - for free! There's also
an on-site restaurant that serves free <mark>gourmet</mark> meals 24 hours a day! What a treat!
   <br><br>
When employees of a San Francisco-based software
company need a break, they <mark>head for</mark> the games room.
Here, they can play video games, pool or table tennis.
Alternatively, staff members can take part in outdoor
activities, like basketball or tennis. The employees of this
company say that their work environment is so <mark>pleasant</mark>
that they often don't want to go home!
<br><br>
Many companies also organise annual holidays and
<mark>outings</mark> for their staff. Last year, a US supermarket chain
took all its employees white-water rafting. And, in the UK,
a mobile phone company organised a special end-of-year
concert for its 17,000 employees. Some of the biggest rock
bands in the UK played at the concert and staff members
had the opportunity to meet the performers - how thrillfng!
<br><br>
Some companies offer their staff members slightly
more unusual perks. For example, a US insurance <mark>firm</mark>
gives all its employees the day off on their birthday, as
well as a gift of $100. The company also offers on-site golf
lessons and yoga classes, and there are even meditation
rooms for staff members to enjoy some quiet time. Many ,
employees <mark>consider</mark> this company to be such a wonderful
place to work that they wouldn't dream of looking for a job
anywhere else!
