A few years ago, I was working in Singapore. During my first week there, while I was travelling on the underground, I saw a strange sign saying 'NO DURlANS' with a picture of a crossed out fruit. I wondered why they were forbidden. It wasn't until later I found out that they smell really, really bad but they're very tasty and healthy. For his reason, many people in Southeast Asia eat them. I was very curious and decided to try for myself.
<br><br>
As I was walking through a market place, a very strong smell hit me. It smelt like someone had left some onions and other vegetables to rot. However, l realised that I was standing next to a stall selling durians. 'I'd like to try a bit of durian,' I told the <mark>merchant</mark> and he said with a smile, 'At your own risk!' He then took a durian from a box, cut it in half with a large knife and then cut a piece of the fruit.
<br>
<br>
When he <mark>handed</mark> it to me, I started having second thoughts. 'What does it taste like?' I wondered. As I was <mark>raising</mark> the fruit to my lips, I suddenly felt sick and a bit dizzy, but I began to eat.
<br>
<br>
The durian was thick and creamy like butter and had a fresh and sweet taste. As soon as I finished eating the piece, the merchant offered me some more.Tactually finished the <mark>entire</mark> fruit. The man looked at me for a <mark>response</mark>. 'Yummy! That was tasty!' I said, so the merchant put three in a bag for me to take home. Unfortunately, l had to walk all the way, because I wasn't allowed on the underground.</div></div>
