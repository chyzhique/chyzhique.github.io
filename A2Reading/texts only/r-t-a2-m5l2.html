Before the development of radio communication, when a ship was in danger there were a number of ways to <mark>signal</mark> for help. Lighting signal flares to show the <mark>location</mark> of the ship or flying a signal flag were very common. Using bells and foghorns or perhaps firing a gun repeatedly were also ways of making other ships hear you. These are still used today in many cases.

However, with the development of wireless telegraphy, sailors started using Morse code to send messages. Morse code is a type of code with long and short sounds or flashes of light
that <mark>stand for</mark> letters of the alphabet. The most well-known Morse code message asking for help is SOS. The letters SOS in international Morse code are: ... --- ...<hr>

► The German <mark>government</mark> was the first to use the SOS signal at the beginning of the 20th century (in 1905). It became an international distress signal in 1908.

► Some people believe that SOS stands for 'Save Our Ship' or 'Save Our Souls', but that's not true. In fact, the letters don't stand for anything; they were just the simplest letters in international Morse code. However, people probably used these phrases to help them remember the letters.
   </div><div class="container" style="background-color: #FFFADD">
► People have used SOS as a visual distress signal by signalling with three short, three long and three short light
flashes or by writing it in the sand or snow. The fact that you can read SOS right side up and <mark>upside down</mark> is very
useful and has made SOS more popular than the word HELP.

► When the Titanic hit an iceberg in 1912 and started sinking, two of the <mark>crew</mark> members used radio
communication to ask for help. They also tried sending an SOS message to a nearby ship, the Californian, by using a
Morse lamp. Unfortunately, the crew of the Californian didn't realise what was happening until it was too late.
