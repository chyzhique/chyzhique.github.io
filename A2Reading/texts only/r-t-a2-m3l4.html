  <i>Come to Sichuan</i></h1>

<h1></canter></h1>
With its beautiful scenery, friendly people and great food, Sichuan Province in China is the ideal holiday destination.
Sichuan is in southwest China and it has many mountains, including the Himalayas to the west. The famous
Yangtze River runs through China, from west to east, crossing Sichuan. The Yangtze isn't as long as the Amazon or the Nile but it's the longest river in Asia.
<br><br>
One of the most impressive sights in Sichuan is the Leshan Giant Buddha, a huge statue carved out of a cliff on the side
of Lingyun Mountain. The statue is more than a thousand years old and over 71 metres tall. It is the largest carved stone
Buddha in the world. 
<br><br>
Not far from the Buddha is Mount Emei. Here you can visit temples or just take photos of the many waterfalls. For
some more beautiful scenery, visit Jiuzhaigou Valley. Jiuzhaigou Valley, in the north of Sichuan , is one of the most
<mark>spectacular</mark> places in China with snow-covered mountains, colourful lakes and beautiful forests.
<br><br>
Chengdu is the capital of Sichuan and is the cultural and industrial centre of the <mark>region</mark>. Chengdu is also home to the
Chengdu Giant Panda Research Base, one of the most important centres in the world for the protection of the Giant
Panda. The Research Centre has <mark>developed</mark> into China Panda City with a museum and a zoo.
<br><br>
After all that sightseeing, you must <mark>definitely</mark> have something to eat. The Sichuanese cook with a lot of chilli
peppers and garlic, and Sichuanese food is hotter and spicier than other types of Chinese cuisine, but it's delicious!</div></div>
