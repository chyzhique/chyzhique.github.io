(2) <input type="text" id="q2" class="changeDiv"> (young) hero in his  town. As Mike was cycling along the river path, he heard a cry coming from the river. He realised that there was a car in the river with a woman and two children inside. The cry was growing weaker and 
(3) <input type="text" id="q3" class="changeDiv">  (weak). Mike jumped into the river and swam towards the car. He knew he had to spend 
(4) <input type="text" id="q4" class="changeDiv"> (little) time as possible in the icy cold  water. When he reached the car, the woman gave him her children and Mike  swam to the shore. Then he went back for the woman. Swimming back again was 
(5) <input type="text" id="q5" class="changeDiv">  (difficult) than he had expected. It was 
(6) <input type="text" id="q6" class="changeDiv"> (hard) than before for Mike to reach the woman because the river was working against him and was taking the woman  
(7) <input type="text" id="q7" class="changeDiv"> (far) and farther away. Mike realised he had to get to her 
(8) <input type="text" id="q8" class="changeDiv">  (quickly) as he could if he was going to save her. Finally, Mike reached the woman and took her to the river bank where her children were waiting.
