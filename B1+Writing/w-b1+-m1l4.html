  <h3>Letter #1</h3>
    <div class="letter">
&emsp; Hi Jackie,<br>
&emsp; I spoke to Jane earlier and she's really excited that we're both going to be at her wedding next Sunday.
<br>
&emsp; I was thinking, since the wedding is going to be in Canterbury, why don't we drive up there together on Friday afternoon and make a weekend out of it?
      My parents have a charming little <span class="tooltip" style="text-decoration-line: underline; text-decoration-style: solid; text-decoration-color: blue;"><span class="tooltiptext">1. Sounds great!</span> stone cottage in the area that we can use.</span> Besides, we can also help Jane out with any <span class="tooltip" style="text-decoration-line: underline; text-decoration-style: solid; text-decoration-color: blue;"><span class="tooltiptext">2. Yes! seating arrangement at reception + check with florist and caterers</span> wedding preparations.</span>
<br>
&emsp; Have you bought Jane and Mark a wedding gift yet? If you haven't, maybe we can <span class="tooltip" style="text-decoration-line: underline; text-decoration-style: solid; text-decoration-color: blue;"><span class="tooltiptext">3. How about Thursday?!</span> go shopping for one together.</span>
I know you'll help me pick out something really nice - you always have fantastic <span class="tooltip" style="text-decoration-line: underline; text-decoration-style: solid; text-decoration-color: blue;"><span class="tooltiptext">4. lamp?</span>gift ideas.</span>
<br> 
&emsp; I was also thinking that when Mark and Jane get back from their honeymoon in Barbados, we should do something together - just the four of us. I miss those days when we would spend whole <span class="tooltip" style="text-decoration-line: underline; text-decoration-style: solid; text-decoration-color: blue;"><span class="tooltiptext">5. Definitely! We should all...</span>afternoons together.</span>
<br>
&emsp; Write back as soon as you can and let me know what you think.
<br>
&emsp; Love,<br>
&emsp; Christine

      <h3>Letter #2 (response)</h3>
<div class="letter"> 
      Hi Christine,
<br>
I think spending the weekend in your parents' cottage in Canterbury is a fantastic idea. I can pick you up after work on Friday.
<br>
Jane will definitely need some help with the wedding arrangements. She must be getting really stressed out now,
as it's only a week away. The last time I spoke to her she mentioned that she'd like some help deciding the seating
arrangement at the reception.
<br>
I have a few gift ideas - how about getting them a lamp for their living room? We can have a look around the shops
on Thursday if you are free. 
<br>
When they get back from their honeymoon, we couId all have dinner at that new Mexican restaurant in Byron Square.
I'm sure they'll love it and they'll have lots to teII us about Barbados.
<br>
Anyway, I'll call you later this week to confirm the details for the weekend.
<br>
Take care,<br>
Jackie

        <h3>4. WRITING TASK</h3>
<h4>A. Read the rubric and the e-mail with the notes. Underline the key words in the rubric. What do you have to include in your e-mail?</h4>

<div class="letter">
  Hi there!<br><br>
I was glad to hear that you'll be at the international meeting of Youth for Peace next weekend. I was wondering, would you like 
  <span class="tooltip"style="text-decoration-line: underline; text-decoration-style: solid; text-decoration-color: blue;"><span class="tooltiptext">Sure!</span>to go together</span>?
I think the event starts at 10am in the town hall, but I'm not really sure how to get there. Could you come and pick me up from my hotel 
  <span class="tooltip"style="text-decoration-line: underline; text-decoration-style: solid; text-decoration-color: blue;"><span class="tooltiptext">OK, but 9am because...</span>at around 9:30am? </span>
<br><br>
I'm really looking forward to meeting the participants from different
countries and especially people from your country. 

Are <span class="tooltip"style="text-decoration-line: underline; text-decoration-style: solid; text-decoration-color: blue;"><span class="tooltiptext">All of them, so...</span>
  any friends of yours</span> going to be there, too? If they're anything like you, they'll be good fun! 
And one more thing, what's the weather like this time of year over there, and 
  <span class="tooltip"style="text-decoration-line: underline; text-decoration-style: solid; text-decoration-color: blue;"><span class="tooltiptext">Suggest...</span>what kind of clothes</span> should I bring with me?

on prompts:
  <ul>
<li>Read the prompts carefully and make sure you include all the points in the notes in your answer<br>
<li>Do not copy the notes given. Try to rephrase them, add comments and information, and use expressions
to show how you feel.<br>
<li>Use linking words to connect your ideas <br>
<li>Use standard grammar and spelling conventions. Avoid forms such as <i>wanna, cu I8r</i> etc<br>
<li>Use appropriate phrases/expressions to express enthusiasm, give informatton, accept decline
  invitations, recommend, suggest etc.
