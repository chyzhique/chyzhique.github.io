Imagine that you are going backpacking for a couple of weeks with some friends, and you can only take two of the devices shown. <hr>
  - First talk to each other about how useful each of these devices would be to you. <br>
  - Then decide which two you would take with you on your backpacking trip and why.

    â–º There are no right or wrong answers but you must make sure to justify your answer. <br>
â–º This is not a monologue, so take turns to speak.<br>
â–º Listen to your partner's opinion and respond by either agreeing or disagreeing with it.<br>
â–º Focus on the written prompts below the visuals to keep the task in mind.<br>
â–º Don't forget that there are two parts to the task. One part is expressed in the instructions as 'First, talk .. .'
and the second part as 'Then decide .. .'. So towards the end of the task, you must reach a decision that
you have negotiated with your partner.
