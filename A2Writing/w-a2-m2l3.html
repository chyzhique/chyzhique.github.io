It was a warm summer evening. Paul was returning home when he  saw two men outside the house of his neighbour, Tom Baker. 
They were carrying his furniture into a van. 
<br><br>
He knew that Tom was moving out  in a few days, so he walked up to one of the men and said, 'Hello, can I give you a hand?' The men just stood there,
looking at Paul. That's when the other man said, 'That would be great'. As soon as Paul helped them finish, the two men quickly, got into the van, thanked 
him and left. Later  while Tom was having dinner, the doorbell rang. It was Tom and he looked very upset.  'Someone broke into my house and took everything!' he shouted. Paul froze 'I'm so stupid!' he thought.
<br><br>
Fortunately, Paul gave a clear descnption of the men to the police and the found  the burglars after
only an hour. Paul helped move everything back into the empty house, but he's never offered to help a
neighbour again.
