<h3>Your VIEWS<br>
CAN WE DO WITHOUT: COMPUTERS</h3>
<div class="bunch">
<h4>DONALD TURDIN, NORWICH</h4>
It is true that computers are very popular nowadays, but they can do more harm than good.
First of all, they are harmful to our health. Using a computer for too many hours can damage
your eyes and cause backaches. What is more, children, teenagers and even adults can easily
become addicted to computers and spend hours in front of the screen instead of socialising
with other people. Lastly, computers that have an Internet connection are useful, but they
are not safe. They can get viruses which can destroy all the programs and delete information.
Personally, I believe that computers are not as important or useful as many people think and we
can definitely do without them.
</div><div class="bunch">
<h4>ELSIE FLANNIGAN, HOLLYHEAD</h4>
Computers help people in more than one way and are becoming more and more popular with
people of all ages. To begin with, computers are very useful as they help us organise our
work and, as a result, we work faster. Also, we can store important information, music or
photos on the computer and with one click open the file we need. In addition, people who
have an Internet connection can download a great amount of information, as well as keep
in touch with family and friends. In my opinion, computers are an important part of our lives
and we cannot live without them.

<h1>WRITING TASK</h1>

<h3> D. Imagine that a magazine has asked you to write your opinion about mobile phones. Write a paragraph using
the ideas in the speaking activity. Your paragraph
should be between 80-100 words.</h3>
  <div class="outline">
❗ When writing a paragraph expressing your opinion:<br>
► use linking words to list points:<i>  firstly, first of all, to begin with, secondly, also, in addition, what is more, finally, lastly.</i> <br>
► use phrases like:<i> In my opinion ... , Personally I believe ...</i> <br>
► give reasons to support your opinion, by using clear examples.
