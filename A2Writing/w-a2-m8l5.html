Hey Linda,
<br><br>
Guess what? I'm finally getting married! I'm going to send you a formal
invitation soon, but I wanted to let you know early so that you can
arrange flights and everything. 
<span class="tooltip" style="text-decoration-line: underline; text-decoration-style: solid; text-decoration-color: blue;"><span class="tooltiptext">Definitely!</span>I really want you to come!</span>
<br><br>The wedding is in three months, on Saturday 4th August, at the Town Hall and the reception is at a hotel nearby. It's a tradition in Toby's family for the bride and groom to go out for dinner with close friends and family before the wedding. 
<span class="tooltip" style="text-decoration-line: underline; text-decoration-style: solid; text-decoration-color: blue;"><span class="tooltiptext">When?</span>
How about joining us?</span>

<br><br>I'm afraid I can't put you up because there will be so much going on. But 
<span class="tooltip" style="text-decoration-line: underline; text-decoration-style: solid; text-decoration-color: blue;"><span class="tooltiptext">No need, can stay with friends</span>I know a nice B&B if you like</span>.
<br><br>It's going to be brilliant. You have to see my dress, and my little nieces are going to be bridesmaids. Just imagine!
<br><br>E-mail me when you can,
<br>Jennifer

        <h4>Reply:</h4>
<div class="letter">
  Hi Jennifer,
<br><br>Congratulations! Toby is a lucky man. You're going to be the perfect couple. Who's going to be the best
man? His brother? I can't wait to see him give a speech!
<br><br>Of course I'll be there. I'll probably come up for a week and see some friends, too. Also, I'd love to
attend your pre-wedding dinner. Which day are you planning it for? I'm so excited for you! I love
weddings!
<br><br>You don't need to worry about a B&B, though. I have some friends from university who live very near
you. I asked them and they said I can stay with them, no problem.
<br><br>Any plans for a honeymoon? Somewhere exotic I expect...
<br><br>Speak to you soon,
<br>Linda

I just wanted to let you know that I'm taking part in a local music festival this
year. I'm a bit nervous though and I'm inviting all my friends to come. 
    <span class="tooltip" style="text-decoration-line: underline; text-decoration-style: solid; text-decoration-color: blue;"><span class="tooltiptext">of course!</span>
      You know, having friendly faces around makes me feel more comfortable.</span>
<br><br>The festival's from Friday the 12th to
Sunday the 14th. I'm performing on
Saturday, but 
    <span class="tooltip" style="text-decoration-line: underline; text-decoration-style: solid; text-decoration-color: crimson;"><span class="tooltiptext">can't / meet on Saturday?</span>
      you should come to town on Friday, so we can spend some time
together</span>. Apart from musical performances,
there are 
      <span class="tooltip" style="text-decoration-line: underline; text-decoration-style: solid; text-decoration-color: orange;"><span class="tooltiptext">ticket? how much?</span>
        many fun activities to do at the
festival, like watch comedy acts, taste
delicious food from around the world, enter
competitions and many more.</span>
<br><br>I really think you should come and be there
to cheer for me. You'll have a great time.
<br><br>Hope you can make it!
