<h1>A DAY I'LL NEVER FORGET</h1>
<hr>
Probably the most embarrassing thing I've ever done was two years ago. I was travelling by
train, going from Paris to London with some friends from university.<br><br>
There were many people on the train, so I had to wait for almost half an hour to get some
coffee. As soon as I sat down with my coffee, I realised I needed to use the bathroom. So, I said
to my friends 'Nobody touch my coffee' and left. However, on my way back to my seat, I saw
one of my friends sipping my coffee. I was furious! 'Hey, that's mine!' I shouted and grabbed
the cup, which wasn't a good idea because I spilt the coffee all over him and even on a few
other passengers. But the worst thing was that the person with the coffee wasn't my friend.
It just looked like him from behind.<br><br>
My friends, who were further up the train, were laughing their heads off. I immediately
apologised to the people but they were still pretty angry with me. I wanted the ground to
swallow me up. I'll never forget that day.

<h1>WRITING TASK</h1>  
<h3>D. Think about a funny, embarrassing or annoying
experience that you have had and write about it.
Your account should be between 100-120 words.</h3>

❗When writing an account of a true event:<br>
        <ul>
<li> use the first person (I, We).<br>
<li>divide your account into paragraphs.<br>
<li>try to make your writing flow by:<br>
<ul><li> writing the events in chronological order. Use Past tenses (Past Simple and Past Progressive).
    <li>using linking words/phrases expressing time (when, while, as, as soon as, before, after, during, until, in the end, etc.), contrast (but, however), cause (because) or result (so, as a result).</li></ul>
<li>try to make it interesting to the reader by using:<br>
<ul><li> a variety of adjectives (surprised, furious, etc.).<br>
    <li> adverbs/adverbial phrases (suddenly, fortunately, to my surprise, etc.).
    <li> idioms(/ nearly jumped out of my skin/ etc.).
    <li> direct speech, questions and exclamations.
    <li> a variety of structures (Comparisons, Relative Clauses, Passive Voice, etc.).
