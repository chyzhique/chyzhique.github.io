<h4>Dr Fred Wilson's<br>
corner</h4>
Dear Dr Wilson,<br>
I need your advice because I feel helpless and don't know what to do. Last
week I had to give a presentation at university with a fellow student. As we
walked to the front of the lecture theatre, I could feel my heart beating fast
and I was sweating. When it was time for me to talk, I just stood there looking
at everyone. I couldn't remember what to say! Fortunately, my fellow student
gave the presentation for me. But who will save me next time? What should
I do? Anxiously waiting for your reply.<br>

Dear Nervous Ned,<br>
Many people are afraid of public speaking. You're not the only one so don't worry. Here are some tips to help you deal with your problem. First of all, you should practise giving your  resentation in front of a mirror until you feel confident. This way you'll have less stress, There are also certain things you can do right before and during your presentation. Before starting, you
should do some kind of physical activity to help reduce your anxiety. Taking a walk is a good idea. Also, while you're giving your presentation, choose a few friendly faces from the audience and focus on them. And don't forget to take deep breaths to feel calm. If all this doesn't work, I advise you to take a training course in public speaking, It will help you get over your fear.<br>
