<h3>My favourite place of entertainment</h3>
I enjoy going out a lot but there's one place I prefer going to more often and that's the
drama club. I find that it's an interesting place as it gives members the chance to spend time with friends, have fun and also learn something new. <mark>We</mark> all meet up <mark>there</mark> to rehearse twice a week, but nobody takes it too seriously. The club offers a nice, relaxing atmosphere. Every year, we put on two performances and everyone gets excited about <mark>them</mark>. We all work together for months to create the scenery and the costumes. Last year we performed A Midsummer Night's Dream which was a big success. The audience couldn't stop applauding! Some of <mark>them</mark> even came back to see it a second
time. It's great fun being part of a drama club and I wouldn't give <mark>it</mark> up for anything in the world!
