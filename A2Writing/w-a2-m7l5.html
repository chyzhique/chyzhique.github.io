Hi Jerry
<br><br>It was great to hear from you. I'm very busy at the moment, working hard at the restaurant. Anyway, I
would be more than happy to give you some information about the cookery training course I attended.
<br><br>To begin with, I'll tell you about the course itself. It was a very well-organised four-week course. The lessons lasted till six in the evening and they were three times a week. They took place at Dewhurst College and the facilities were great. As for the chefs, they were experienced and very helpful. I found it very easy to work with them and I've even kept in touch with some of them. However, the fees were
quite expensive, but it was definitely worth it. When the course was completed, I received a certificate
and, as you already know, I managed to find a job with in weeks.
<br><br>So, if you're thinking about signing up for the cookery course, I recommend it. If there's anything else
you'd like to know, don't hesitate to ask.
<br><br>Best wishes,
<br>Monica
