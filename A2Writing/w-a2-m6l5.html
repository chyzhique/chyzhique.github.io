<h3>FILM REVIEW <br>by Joanna Stone</h3>
  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2d/Quantum_of_Solace_-_UK_cinema_poster.jpg" style="width:50%; float:right; margin:0.5rem">
&emsp; &emsp; Quantum of Solace is an action film which was directed by Marc Forster. It is the 22nd Bond film and Daniel Craig stars as James Bond for the second time. The villain of the film, Dominic Green, is played by Mathieu
Amalric and the Bond girl, Camille, is the beautiful Olga Kurylenko.<br>
&emsp; &emsp;The film is set in different cities around the world. Bond puts his life in danger trying to find the people responsible for the death of the woman he loved, Vesper Lynd. He finds out that Dominic Green, a member of
the Quantum organisation is behind Vesper's murder. As he tries to catch Green, he meets Camille Montes who helps him take his revenge.<br>
&emsp; &emsp;Overall, I found the film very exciting. The action-packed scenes and great special effects kept me interested throughout the whole film. I definitely recommend it,
especially to action-lovers.
