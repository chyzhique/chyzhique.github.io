Hi Gavin,<br><br>
How are things? Listen, you stayed at a campsite last summer and you really liked it there, right? Well, I need
some information. Could you tell me a bit more about it?<br><br>
Firstly, can you hire tents there, or do I have to bring my own? Also, does it have showers and what are they
like? Finally, could you tell me how much it costs? Do you pay daily or every week?<br><br>
I'm planning to go next month, so please send me a reply with any information. Thanks a lot.<br><br>
Bye for now,<br>
Peter

<h1>WRITING TASK</h1>
</header>
<h3>You are planning a trip to Paris. Your friend recently stayed at a hotel there and was very pleased with it. Write an e-mail to your friend asking for more information about the hotel. Choose three ideas from activity above. Your e-mail should be between 80-100 words.</h3>

<h4>When writing an e-mail asking for information:</h4>
► use set phrases to say why you are writing <i>(e.g. I'm interested in ... so ... , I want some information about..., I'd like to know ... )</i>. <br>
► use words/phrases to list your questions <i>(e.g. firstly, first of all, next, then, also, finally)</i>.<br>
► don't use direct questions only. Use indirect questions, too <i>(e.g. Can/Could you tell me ... ?, Do you know ... ?)</i>.<br>
