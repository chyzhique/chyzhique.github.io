Lee arrived at the airport at 6am. He was going away on a business trip but before leaving, he wanted to see his friend, Oliver. Oliver was coming back from a trip abroad and was arriving at 6:15. Lee waited for him at <b>arrivals</b>. When Oliver's plane<b> landed</b>, they went to a cafe. When it was time for Lee to leave, he went to <b>departures</b> and checked in his suitcase. Unfortunately, there was a two-hour <b>delay</b>. However,
while he was waiting, he fell asleep. Luckily, someone woke him up just before his plane <b>took off!</b> He ran to the <b>gate</b> and was the last passenger to board the plane. He showed his <b>boarding card</b> to the <b>flight attendant</b> and went to his seat.
