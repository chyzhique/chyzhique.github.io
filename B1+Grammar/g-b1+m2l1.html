A few years ago, I <span style="color: violet">was working </span>
for an international company in Zurich. One Monday morning after an exhausting weekend, my alarm didn't go off, 
so I <span style="color: red">got</span>
to work late. I <span style="color: red">rushed </span>
into my office, <span style="color: red">sat </span>
down at my desk and tried to look busy. Like any Monday
morning, some of my colleagues <span style="color: violet">were working </span>
while others <span style="color: violet">were discussing </span>
their weekend. At that moment, our boss walked in, and to our surprise, he announced, 
'I have arranged a Corporate Clients weekend in Dubai for all the staff. As Dubai is hot, we all imagined ourselves in swimmmg suits on a beach. But that is not what happened. While we <span style="color: violet">were wondering </span>
about what clothes to take for the weekend, our boss <span style="color: red">said, </span>
'Don't forget to bring some warm clothes for skiing!' Of course, we thought he was joking, but as it turned out, we stayed at the Ski Dubai resort and went skiing every day' The biggest surprise of the whole weekend came when we saw
our boss doing some really fancy tricks on a snowboard'.
At work, he was always very serious and never <span style="color: red">showed </span>
that there was an adventurous side to him.
